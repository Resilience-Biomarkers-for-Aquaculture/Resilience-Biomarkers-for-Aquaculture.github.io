## Interview for The Scientist
 - [https://www.the-scientist.com/lab-tools/mapping-the-cellular-social-network-of-proteins-65385](https://www.the-scientist.com/lab-tools/mapping-the-cellular-social-network-of-proteins-65385)

## Geoduck reproductive development
- Met with Brent and Grace about selecting tissue samples
- looked through [Grace's histology figs](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/scaphapoda/index.php?dir=Grace%2FCharacterization+of+Reproductive+Maturation+in+Geoducks%2F)
- came up with [this list of candidates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10PyIMrQopm2fmHF9SQpbmliy37cE41-oJ-s-NlxrFUQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- need to locate hemolymph and corresponding gonad tissue 
	- this is [Emma's box](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1aSq7pSNVnJhCr9iK3_VMRSJd3UOBCflC)
	- Grace's boxes are in  rack 8, Column 1, rows 1 (Geoduck Tissue Samples + Hemolymph, 11/7/2014) and 3 (Geoduck Tissue Samples + Hemolymph, 1/2/2015, Grace Crandall)


## Geoduck Hemolymph sampling #3

I sampled Star first, went in about halfway on the needle and had resistance when aspirating so pulled out a little then it started coming up. After withdrawing the needle, her siphon constricted a lot and then plumped back out a little. I returned her to her tank, then sampled from Chewy and got hemolymph right away. Noticed the same reflex after withdrawing the needle only less dramatic. By the time i returned Chewy to the tank, Star had plumped out more. I moved both to a tank with ~5mL shellfish diet at 2:45pm

## Geoduck purchasing:
	- 4.6L liquid nitrogen in Bagley
	- 5 pumps from petco
	- calcium assay (sam)

## tested paint pens on shells 

## Judged GSS speaker session 3:30-5

## Juvenile Geoduck OA RRBS data
- bismark finished!
- need to run rsync --archive --progress --verbose  
- need to run methylkit
