title: Mon. Sept. 30, Juv. Geoduck Var.low v amb Respirometry
category: Geoduck response to low pH
---

Ran respirometry analysis of the three trials I've done so far.

- markdown report here: [Resp.Calculations.ST.md](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/amb_v_varlowpH_juvis/analyses/Respirometry/Resp.Calculations.ST.md)

- conclusions: 
	- there was a significant parental effect from the last trial (which was 2 weeks of exposure) when the data were normalized by wet weight.  
	- the var.low parental history animals seem to show less variation in their metabolic rates compared to amb parental history. They also show slightly reduced rates
	- I'm not sure how we determine if this is an advantage or disadvantage. Does reduced metabolic rate mean the animals can go into a 'hibernation state' or does it mean they can't adequately supply their demands?
