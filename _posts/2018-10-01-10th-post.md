## My goals today
1. Get Husky card  
2. Get bus pass  
3. Geoduck meeting @ 1:30p
	* notes from meeting:
		+ How frequently to sample
		+ Why are animals limited to 80?
			+ because feeding of live algae is limiting 
				+ benefits of live algae vs. paste
					+ paste better because doesn't mess with pH and we can have more animals that way
		+ 

## Assessing Global DNA Methylation with ELISA kit

We want to determine global DNA methylation in:
1. polyploid oysters (triploids vs. tetraploids)
2. sea lice
3. heat stressed polyploid oysters 


The Cgigas male gamete genome = 15% CpGs methylated (Olson and Roberts 2014, Gavery and Roberts 2013)
**This is not the global methylation; 15%/total CpGs are methylated. The Global methylation includes CHH, etc and of all Cytosines typically about
