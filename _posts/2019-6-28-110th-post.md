## Test out digest and size selection

**RRBS DIGEST**

Prepared the following reaction 4x with Sample 3 gDNA (418ng/ul):

- 2uL of DNA
- 0.5uL MspI
- 1uL CutSmart
- 6uL H2O

- incubate at 37C 1 hour
- add 0.5uL Taq a1
- incubate at 65C for 30min
- let cool to RT then hold on ice

**SIZE SELECTION**

PART 1:

- add 6uL beads to each sample (0.6X DNA:Bead ratio), vortex
- incubate at RT 10 min
- magnetic stand for 5 min
- remove and save supernatent
	- * one sample only had 14uL, not 16uL so that means it only had 8uL of digest reaction to start so ratio was actually 0.75X; not 0.6X

PART 2:

- add:
	- 10uL beads (0.75X intial to 2X final)
	- 12uL beads (0.6X initial to 1.8X)
	- 14uL beads (0.6X initial to 2X final)
- vortex samples and incubate at RT 10 min
- magnetic stand 5 min
- remove supernatent	
- Wash beads (from part 1 and part 2) with 500uL 80% EtOH
- Repeat wash 1X
- Let beads dry 2-5min at RT (until EtOH smell gone)
- Resuspend beads in 12uL elution buffer (preheated to 50C)
- Incubate at RT for 10 min
- Bind beads 5 min
- Transfer supernatent to clean tube
- measure concentration of part 2 s/n
	- 0.75X to 2X = 3.74ng/ul = 45ng yield
	- 0.6X to 1.8X = 8.8ng/ul = 105ng yield
	- 0.6X to 2X 	=  	10ng/ul = 120ng yield
	- STD2 = 9.98ng/ul


**Load gel:**

Lanes:

1. Ladder (o'generuler 100bp-1kb ladder) 
2. 0.75X to 2X elution from part 1 (large frags excluded)
3. 0.75X to 2X elution from part 2 (size selected frags)
4. 0.75X to 2X supernatent from part 2 (small frags excluded)
5. 0.6X to 1.8X elution from part 2 (size selected frags)
6. 0.6X to 2X eluction from part 2 (size selected frags)
7. 0.6X to 1.8X supernatent from part 2 (small frags excluded)
8. 0.6X to 1.8X elution from part 1 (large frags excluded)

**CONCLUSIONS:**

- 1ug of DNA yields enough for the library prep after size selection
- Don't need to digest overnight; maybe digest for 2 hours with MspI and 1 hour for Taq a1; also will be using more enzyme in real RRBS run (30U and 60U, respectively). I only used 10U here
- DNA:Bead ratios for size selection:
	- 0.75X to 2X gives range closest to 100-300bp
	- 0.6X keeps too many fragments > 300 
	- 1.8X final ratio removes too many fragments around 100bp
	- If I do the lower selection 2x, I'll have a better chance of removing small fragments

**PLAN:** 


**RRBS DIGEST**

DNA: aliquot 1ug of DNA and add nanopure water up to 20uL so all DNA is 1ug in 20uL final vol.

Prepare the following reaction mix:

| 1 rxn |	21 rxns| reagent |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 20uL  |  ---   | DNA     |
| 1.5uL | 31.5uL |  MspI   |
| 3uL   |   63uL | CutSmart|
| 5.5uL | 115.5uL| H2O     |

Add 10uL reaction mix to each tube of 20uL of DNA for 30uL total rxn vol.

37C 2 hour

Prepare the following reaction mix:

| 1 rxn |	21 rxns| reagent |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 2.5uL | 52.5uL | Taq a1  |
| 1uL   |   21uL | CutSmart|
| 6.5uL | 136.5uL| H2O     |


add 10uL reaction mix to each tube (now 40uL total rxn vol.)

65C for 1 hour

let cool to RT then hold on ice


**SIZE SELECTION**

PART 1:

- add 30uL beads to each sample (0.75X DNA:Bead ratio), vortex
- incubate at RT 10 min
- magnetic stand for 5 min
- keep supernatent

PART 2:

- add 50uL beads (0.75X intial to 2X final)
- vortex samples and incubate at RT 10 min
- magnetic stand 5 min
- remove supernatent	
- Wash beads (from part 1 and part 2) with 500uL 80% EtOH
- Repeat wash 1X
- Let beads dry 2-5min at RT (until EtOH smell gone)
- Resuspend beads in 10uL elution buffer (preheated to 60C)
- Incubate at RT for 10 min
- Bind beads 5 min
- Transfer supernatent to clean tube

_second_ _purification_ _step_

- add 20uL beads to each tube
- vortex samples and incubate at RT 10 min
- magnetic stand 5 min
- remove supernatent	
- Wash beads (from part 1 and part 2) with 500uL 80% EtOH
- Repeat wash 1X
- Let beads dry 2-5min at RT (until EtOH smell gone)
- Resuspend beads in 21uL elution buffer (preheated to 60C)

- measure concentrations
