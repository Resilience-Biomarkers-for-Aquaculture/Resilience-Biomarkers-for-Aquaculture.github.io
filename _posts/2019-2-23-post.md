## Ploidy Global DNA methylation

### preliminary data: ploidy x heatstress effects on methylation in mantle tissue

polynomial curve gave the best fit line but not the best estimate of % methylation of standards

linear curve including only data from 0, 0.1, 1, and 5% methylation standards gave the best estimate of % methylation of standards


**Previous conclusions:** 

- in one individual, methylation levels went from greatest to least in:  
	1. Gonad
	2. Mantle
	3. Muscle
	4. Ctenidia

- triploid and diploid controls had about the same methylation levels in mantle tissue
- heatstress led to a decrease in methylation levels in both diploid and triploid, but more dramatic decrease in triploid


### new data: ploidy x heatstress effects on methylation in ctenidia tissue

the best fit linear curve (using only STDs 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, and 1%) overestimates the % methylation when you plug the STD absorbances into the equation
When we do polynomial regression using
