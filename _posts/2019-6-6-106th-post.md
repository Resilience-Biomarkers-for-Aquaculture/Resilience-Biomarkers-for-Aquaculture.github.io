## Strip-spawned juveniles (March 17, 2019) from ambient or varibable low pH exposed broodstock

- Matt had turned pump up to 140rpm because the draw rate out of the algae header has been slower 
	- lines may need to be cleaned out!

- measured shell lengths (width - the shortest distance on their shell) of animals in a ~2 mL grab sand/seawater from H2_T2
	- **Measurement protocol:** 
		- turned a 3mL plastic transfer pipette into a spoon by cutting the bulb in half to get the grab
		- put grab into a petri dish and added ~ 3ml more seawater
		- used another 3mL transfer pipette that I cut the tip to be wide to transfer individual animals onto a sedgewick slide wiht 1mm grids
		- took pictures of each animal ([pictures here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RtDMhIaQ35Xxr6rN7n6V1XoHyS90bPDk))
	- OBSERVATIONS: 18 animals were ~1-2mm 
	- CONCLUSION: they are too small to be seived on the 3mm mesh, which is the minimum size Matt sends to growers 	

- guts of many H2_T2 animals seem lighter in color than they did in the past

	- CONCLUSION: feed them more; this is most likely an animal density to algal density issue
	- see [Marshall et al. 2014 paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15222055.2014.886645?tab=permissions&scroll=top)
		- low density animals have to move more to search for food, using more energy requiring more food
	- At 12pm, I turned pump up to 180 rpm
	- Plan is to swap out the 6402-14 skinny tubing for wider tubing when it arrives tomorrow. Matt will do this.

**Plans:**

Last week of June:  

1. measure and count animals  
  **Counting protocol:**

- rinse seed to one corner of screen
	- can shake screens in water bath 
- rinse seed off screen into beaker with seawater
- measure a sample in a graduated cylinder
	- pour seed from beaker spout into a graduated cylinder
	- tap cylinder to get animals to lay flat and packed with siphons receded
	- measure 25-50mL
	- pour cylinder contents onto dark plastic surface
		- ![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1E38cvbM5Vb2f_57LUKTyvaQESWvCkvtc)
	- spread animals into a circle about 3 'rows' of animals wide
		- ![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1C-PnnpwxSsKbxAfo5cTXkdcEN74Ee7hx)
	- mark starting position and count all animals with clicker to get # animals/mL
- pour animals remaining in beaker into same graduated cylinder, again tapping to compress animals
	- Matt counted around 500 animals in 50mL.

2. Prepare for thermal and pH stress experiment:
	- see ideas [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E12ATHeWXF2Bpe7O6xf3V9RHvVF4DKcZ10FEyvitWL8/edit)


## Sam's experiment: March 1, 2019 ambient broodstock volitional spawn

**Water Chemistry:**

- took [discrete measurements](https://github.com/shellytrigg/P_generosa/blob/master/Water_Chemistry/data/Titrator/Daily_Temp_pH_Sal.csv) 
- poisoned TA samples and stored them under the counter where the titrator is here:
