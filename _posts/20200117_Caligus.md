12C 32 psu RNAseq data as control ?

31 
control from day 0 (before infection): but fish are bigger dev effect minimal

PCA of all data to see how treatment groups cluster

CLC: did enrichment


- why were the 31 day samples compared to the control in the first figure and not in the second comparison where everything was compared relative to 16C-32PSU for 31 day analysis? Why do that comparison?



extremes had the lowest infection
does the fish do something magical or do the lice not attach at the extremes?

ROS: a compound that gives silver color in salmon skin (hypoxanthine). the concentration is relative to salinity (higher in salinity). it's a substrate for xanthine oxido-reductase which generates ROS and is a pro-inflammatory response

- temp and salinity drives the immune response. So look specifically at immune related genes

- how does time affect the regulation of transcription (expression)
- how does methylation correlate with expression
	- is there a relationship with 
	- compare methylation 

- pick out transcripts affected 
	 
- what CLC needs for epigenetic analysis
- perform gene and promoter DM analysis with glm
	- bedtools intersect CpGs with 
		- gene.gff
		- promoter track
			- need to create this (2.5kb upstream) 
		- genome in 250 bp chunks
			- bedtools flank -i .gff -g GCF_000233375.1_ICSASG_v2_genomic.fa.fai -l 2500
