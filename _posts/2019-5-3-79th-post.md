title: May 8, 2019  Geoduck broodstock hemolymph DMR calling

## Running methylkit:
I had planned to run MethylKit on Emu's RStudio web interface to find DMRs in the WGBS hemolymph. In reviewing [a previous MethylKit R script](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/methylkit_JuviPgenr_allData/Pgenr_Juvi_OA_RRBS_onEmu.Rmd), I realized I need sorted bam files, which my [initial bismark mox script](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/scripts/20190415_BismarkAlignAS1.2I60_Pgenr070_10K.sh) didn't include. So I submitted [a new mox job to sort my bams](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/scripts/20190508_sort_dedup_bams.sh). Once the job finishes (after Mox maintenance), I will copy the sorted bams over to gannet and then on to Emu so I can run the Rstudio web interface (a little painful, but getting there!).

## Running methylpy
So I thought it might be easier to install [methylpy](https://github.com/yupenghe/methylpy) on the server and do DMR calling with this python program instead of with MethylKit in R. Turns out installing this on Mox was too challenging as I kept getting permission denied messages. So I tried installing it on Ostrich which turned out to also be very challenging. Finally, I got it installed and functioning after correctly installing GSL. I am [currently running methylpy DMRfind on Ostrich](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/WGBS_conditionedBroodstockHemolymph/Methylpy_call_DMRs.ipynb).
