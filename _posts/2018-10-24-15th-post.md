- dungeness crab chitin shells vs. calcium carbonate shells explanation for Jenny Stock @ NOAA WCNMS
	- The major take home points from the sources include:
		- the major source of calcium carbonate used for exoskeleton calcification in marine crabs is from their ocean environment (1). They absorb it through their gills (2).
    	- During exoskeleton calcification, calcium carbonate is deposited into the shell's network of chitin fibers (1,3).
    	- Calcium carbonate is the most important inorganic compound of the mineral phase in crustacean shells (2) because:
        	- it provides rigidity in the exoskeleton (1,3)
        	- it can be resorbed by the animal and facilitate internal acid-base regulation (see attached diagram from (4), as well as other physiological processes like signal transduction (5).
