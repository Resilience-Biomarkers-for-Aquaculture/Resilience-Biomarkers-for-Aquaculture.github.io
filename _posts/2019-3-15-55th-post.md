The Pacific oyster has major ecological and economic importance serving as a biofilter and habitat in coastal ecosystems, and contributing over $190M to annual marine aquaculture revenue. However, little is known about the landscape of protein expression during early development, a time when mass mortality is common which can negatively impact industry and ecosystems. To better characterize physiological pathways and associated networks active during oyster development we performed a developmental time series proteomics analysis of larval cultures reared at 23°C and 29°C. These temperatures were selected based on the reports from the aquaculture industry that differential performance is observed in oysters at these temperatures. We found differentially abundant proteins among larval cultures reared at different temperatures and a larval culture that experienced mass mortality. Results from functional protein network analyses provide deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying fundamental developmental processes and mortality events. This proteomics analysis combined with survival and development observations offers greater clarity on environmental conditions that can improve aquaculture production.
