## Geoduck hemolymph calcium assay

- made new 20uL 1:1 dilutions from hemolymph samlpes in 1x Calcium Assay Buffer and trashed the old dilutions since [protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Caymen_CalciumAssayKit_96well.pdf) didn't mention storing dilutions was possible
- realiquoted 20uL gonad supernatent and didn't dilute 
- used the standards diluted on Friday and stored at 4C over the weekend
- loaded 10uL each sample into columns 1-4 of the 96-well clear bottom assay plate according to the [plate map under 'PlateMap' tab on this googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10PyIMrQopm2fmHF9SQpbmliy37cE41-oJ-s-NlxrFUQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- Mixed Calcium Assay reagent 1 and 2 in a 1:1 mixture (made 10 mL total) and used a reservoir and a multi-channel pipette to add 200uL to all wells. Wells tunred purple!
- met Emma at Genome Sciences to read the plate at 575nm 
	- [data here](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/Hemolymph_Calcium_Assay/data/Shelly%2012102018.xls)
- samples were much higher than the standards so I went back and diluted them further making 1:12 dilutions of hemolymph samples by adding 50uL 1x Calcium Assay Buffer to the remaining 10uL of 1:1 diluted samples, and 1:1 dilutions of gonad samples since these were not too far off
- loaded 10uL each sample and standards into columns 5-8 of the 96-well clear bottom assay plate according to the [plate map under 'PlateMap' tab on this googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10PyIMrQopm2fmHF9SQpbmliy37cE41-oJ-s-NlxrFUQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- re-read the plate again, [data here](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/Hemolymph_Calcium_Assay/data/Shelly%2012102018%20plate2.xls)

- made some plots in the [xls files](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/tree/master/Hemolymph_Calcium_Assay/data) to get a rough idea if Ca might correlate with reproductive development.
