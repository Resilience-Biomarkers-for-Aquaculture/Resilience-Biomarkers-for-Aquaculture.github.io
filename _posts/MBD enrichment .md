## MBD enrichment 

From [MethylMiner FAQs](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/ME10025?SID=srch-srp-ME10025#/ME10025?SID=srch-srp-ME10025):

"Typical total yields of mammalian CpG-methylated DNA are 3-20% of the input mass of DNA, or 0.3-5.0 µg when starting with 10-25 µg. Yield is depends on the method of DNA fragmentation. Fragmenting to relatively short lengths will reduce the total mass recovered. Also, if any of the DNA is denatured or reduced to tiny oligos and nucleotides by the fragmentation, this "degraded" DNA will not bind the MethylMiner beads efficiently, and thus the yield will be lower."

**Calculating percent error of the MBD pulldown:**

Since mammalian genomes have about 70-80% methylation of CpGs [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996472/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996472/), the theoretical yield should be 

Based on this answer, the percent error of the MBD enrichment is:

To determine how much yield we can expected from 200ng of DNA where the genome is 1% methylated, 


Human body louse is 28% GC content (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2901460/)


Human genome is 3,234,830,000 bp
There are 28M CpGs
There are 19.6M-22.4M mCpGs (70-80% methylated)
0.6-0.69% of the whole genome is methylated

Sea lice genome is 506,970,227 bp
There are 11.5M CpGs
There are 115K mCpGs (1%)
0.023% of the whole genome is methylated

Input: 100ng
Output: 3ng
