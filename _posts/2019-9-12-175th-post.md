## Multi Sample BamQC 
Generateed multi sample BamQC report with this jupyter notebook: [https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/MultiBamQC_allEPIsamples.ipynb](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/MultiBamQC_allEPIsamples.ipynb)

## Geoduck genome 9/12 call:
- Decided we will focus on day10 comparison all groups
	- next week we will compare:
		- DMGs (Hollie)
		- DMLs (Steven)
		- DMRs (Shelly)
	- we will decide if analyses are redundant and if we should just go with one and then focus on the functional analysis
- one idea for TE analysis:  compare TEs with DMRs to all TEs
	- is there a specific TE family that has DMRs?
- a method for plotting chromosomes with colored regions:  [karyoplotter](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/karyoploteR.html)
- [methylation plotter](http://maplab.imppc.org/methylation_plotter/) (web interface Steven posted)
