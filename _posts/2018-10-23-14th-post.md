- Presented OA NMFS talk @ 10am on [Crab metabolomics and OA](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jUucu8j3sm1XI_Re74RagTNYicYkmQSt)

- Updated [yesterday's notebook entry](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/shellywanamaker.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-10-22-13th-post.md)

- Oyster seed protein analysis
	- [ASCA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/23/14/1792/189939) 
		- a gene/protein/metabolite with high absoulte loadings value in a specific component means it follows the behavior described by the component
		- a gene/protein/metabolite with high residuals is poorly modelled by the component
		- ASCA in MetStat gives us loadings
		- ASCA in MetaboAnalyst uses two statistics: leverage and SPE (squared prediction error) to quantify loadings and residuals
