I was initially thinking to do respirometry/preserve at the following time points:
- 24 hours (just in case the animals don't make it past 1 week)
- 1 week 
- 2 weeks
- 3 weeks
- 4 weeks
I had also wanted to do some acute stress trials (temperature and salinity) starting after week 1, but I'm concerned I won't have enough animals from both sets of parents to do all of the above. I'm more interested in acute stress response than growth and survival so my vote's to prioritize that, but what does everyone else think?
