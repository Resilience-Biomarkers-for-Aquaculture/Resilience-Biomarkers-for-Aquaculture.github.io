## experimental plans

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Bt66XE4MpND6zPW8NF8JkxBy3fPSF5ac)

[biological response measurement ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E12ATHeWXF2Bpe7O6xf3V9RHvVF4DKcZ10FEyvitWL8/edit?usp=sharing)

**options for low pH treatment:**

1. piggy-back on Sam's treatment: constant low pH 7.0 total scale
2. variable diel low pH to simulate lagoon conditions

**options for high temperature treatment:**

1. constant high temperature of 20C
2. constant high temperature of 29C (this will likely kill them before 1 month)
3. variable diel high temperature of 29C to simulate lagoon conditions


#### Space:
- There is space avaiable across from our current heath stacks where the totes to put another heath stack in.
- Matt should have space for 4 trays in some other heath stacks to house any left over animals if needed 

**NEXT STEPS:**  

- begin heath stack set up directly across from heath stacks
	- test out heat control, flow, etc.

## Equipment update

- Thermometer for discrete temp measurements errored out. See [slack post](https://geoduckffar.slack.com/archives/CB0E1FU3E/p1563992540003200). It may just be the probe, but need to test this.
	- Ordered another [waterproof one](https://www.traceable.com/4132-traceable-rtd-platinum-thermometer.html) to use in the meantime.
- Apex status:
	- Controller not lighting up at all when plugged into everything. Need to call support and get help troubleshooting this
	- Power strip lights up fine
	- Aqua buses:
		- how many can be linked to 1 Apex controller?
	- Probes:  
		- ideally need 12 pH + temp sets
	- brought Controller back to UW to troubleshoot

- Have 20 total heath trays plumbed for downwelling
- Can use 1 micron screen mesh tray inserts with large grain sand (Matt has extra). 
	- **NEED** to check:
		- \# of good quality inserts we have (ideally 10)
		- \# of inserts that need dividers added
			- can cut dividers from black plexiglass upstairs in the hatchery 	
- Controlled heating source:
	- **NEED** 2 heat rods that can be plugged into the apex
		- have these at UW, need to test  
- Flow: 
	- if doing constant pH, **NEED** 4 pumps with adjustable flow if using same header conicals as Sam
	- if doing diel variable pH, use different conical and donâ€™t need adjustable flow 
		- extra pumps at hatchery (imagitarium secondary pumps used for circulation in broodstock experiment) 
		- would need additional probe set
- More equipment will free up when Sam is done by the end of August 

	
## Checked on animals

Size difference between H2T3 animals and H2T1 animals from cascade feeding

In-flow hose was not going directly into the heath tray insert in H2T1:

Tried to break up algae and clear mesh to improve flow of food and shuffled trays around to new order:
1. H2T1
2. H2T5
3. H2T7
4. H2T3
5. H2T6 (extras)
6. H2T2 (low density)

*only swapped H2T3 with H2T1 because these trays showed the biggest size differences.

*Left H2T6 and H2T2 in same positions because they had a lot of die off and aren't going to be part of the experiment.

Size data (photos) for all animals are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hNFCW9TIsBKrTUCVugdYiUe3retstjvS). Size ranges for all are about 2-6mm. I will do individual measurements with image J

Survival and size data for larval rearing through now I think is too convoluted to draw conclusions from parental exposure. 

Prior to pH x temp experiment, I can size select to start with animals of similar sizes across the board.
