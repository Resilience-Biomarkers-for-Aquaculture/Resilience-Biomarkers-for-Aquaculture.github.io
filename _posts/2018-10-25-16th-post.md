## Juvenile geoduck RRBS data analysis

- FSH 546:   
	- organize [repo](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/Shelly_Pgenerosa)
	- Geoduck methylation analysis:
		- coverage
			- CpG methylation-what percentage of CpGs detected are methylated?
				- can get this info from:
					- Bismark methylation extractor
			- nucleotide coverage
				- Bismark nucleotide coverage report will plot % nucleotide coverage in sample and in genome. Expect sample and genome percentages to match

## Geoduck Broodstock Experiment
- Tritrator reagents to order:
	- Distilled (DI) water
	- pH Buffer 4.0 (Fisher SB101-4) Fisher pH4.0 buffer 4L (cat: SB101-4)
	- pH Buffer 7.0 (Fisher SB107-4) Fisher ph7.0 buffer 4L (cat: SB101-4)
	- pH buffer 10.0 (Fisher SB115-4) Fisher ph10.0 buffer 4L (cat: SB115-4)
	- 0.1M Hydrochloric acid from Dickson Lab Andrew Dickson	1 x 1000mL alkalinity titrant
	- check [Hollie's protocol](https://github.com/hputnam/Geoduck_Conditioning/blob/master/Protocols/20180820_Roberts_Titrator_Protocol_(PT_WHITNEY)) against Pt. Whitney inventory
