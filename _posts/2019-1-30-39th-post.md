## Geoduck Broodstock Experiment

#### Gonad slices sent to HCS, Inc. for histology

List of samples sent:  [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fgb5abuMR8TyiR9hbIjUW2mRg9eeoAd3pD3CdlPlqlo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fgb5abuMR8TyiR9hbIjUW2mRg9eeoAd3pD3CdlPlqlo)

Order form: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UXb3Vc2scDMOwDsE5kWIyt8ozCF-buhj](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UXb3Vc2scDMOwDsE5kWIyt8ozCF-buhj)

Shipped through FedEx as hazardous goods of expected quantities, each of the 5 cassette jars contained 30 mL of 70% Ethanol (Stabilizer from PAXgene kit).

#### Low pH conditioning plans

Steven and I discussed stopping the treatment on Friday and combining the low pH group crates (Tank 1 and 2) into one ambient tote and Tank 3 and 4 crates into one ambient tote. This will make room for more broodstock and will hopefully rescue the low pH conditioned animals so we can get them to spawn/strip spawn. See slack discussion.

## Oyster Seed Proteomics

#### Map the proteins to 2019 Uniprot accessions

For re-mapping [the fasta](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/halfshell/bu-git-repos/nb-2017/C_gigas/data/Cg_Giga_cont_AA.fa) to 2019 Uniprot accessions [like Steven did in the past](https://github.com/sr320/nb-2017/tree/master/misc), I started the jupyter notebook linked below on Ostrich and it's currently still running:

#### Github desktop on Ostrich
Also got github desktop to work on Ostrich by downloading [this older version](https://central.github.com/mac/latest) that I found [here](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/2885). With the newest version, the graphics don't work when you remote desktop in. But this older version works fine, probably because Ostrich is still running El Cap OS.
