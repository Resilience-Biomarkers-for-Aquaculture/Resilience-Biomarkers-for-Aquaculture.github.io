I realized removing part of the 20191108_combine-filt_allc.sh code (#if the context is CG print the chromosome and position) limited the output to require common sites AND coverage across 3/4 samples.

Steps:
1. create bed file for sites that have 5x coverage and are covered by 3/4 samples/group
	- end up with one bedfile for each group
2. Filter allc files for sites that have coverage in 3/4 samples
	- create awk array and parse, add allc sample name as column?
	- end up with one filtered allc file/sample (20)
3.   combine all filtered allc files together
