title: My First Post
---

This is my **first** lab notebook post using GitHub's markdown.

###My goals today are to:  
	1. Get my first lab notebook post out  
	2. Start on my [first task](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/379#event-1850948742) to familiarize with the lab's general DNA methylation analysis pipeline for PE bisulfide sequencing data  
	3. Try to find a monitor and keyboard from the surplus room in SAFS  

 
This is an example of how to include images in posts and of how much I love shellfish

Let's see how this goes!
