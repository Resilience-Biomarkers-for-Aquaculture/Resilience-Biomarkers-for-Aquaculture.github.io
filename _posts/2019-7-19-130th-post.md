## Received salmon sea lice methylome data!!

### copy data to Gannett metacarcinus folder

- I received [this url](https://app.globus.org/transfer?&origin_id=178d2980-769b-11e9-8e59-029d279f7e24&origin_path=/sequencing_only/uw/shelly_trigg/&add_identity=76b4c8c7-2495-4723-9bd0-ea175e470ff3) from the sequencing core
- I mounted gannet via finder -> connect to server
- I installed Globus Connect Personal on Ostrich and gave the Globus app writing permissions to my metacarcinus folder on Gannet
- I navigated to my Globus account file manager section via the provided url and could see my sequencing data "UW_Trigg_190718.tar.gz" 148.22GB.
- I selected the "Transfer of Sync to..." option, entered the computer name "Ostrich" which I entered when setting up Globus Connect Personal app, entered the path "/Volumes/web/metacarcinus/Salmo_Calig/FASTQS/". Then clicked start.

- I navigated to the Activity section of Globus and could see the info being transferred (26GB in 10min)

- after a couple hours, I received an email notification and could see in the status section that the transfer had completed successfully

### copy data from Gannett to mox
ran this command:  

	rsync --archive --progress --verbose strigg@ostrich.fish.washington.edu:/Volumes/web/metacarcinus/Salmo_Calig/FASTQS/UW_Trigg_190718.tar.gz /gscratch/srlab/strigg/data/Salmo_Calig/FASTQS/

I decided to make two species folders rather than have them combined, and wanted to remove the data that was not Salmon or sea lice fastqs, so ran the following commands:

	tar -xvf UW_Trigg_190718.tar.gz
	cd UW_Trigg_190718_done/
	rm -r Reports/
	rm -r Stats/
	rm -r Undetermined_S0_L00*
	cd ../../../
	mkdir Caligus
	mv Salmo_Calig/ Ssalar
	cd Ssalar/
	cd FASTQS/
	cd ..
	cd Caligus/
	mkdir FASTQS
	mv ../Ssalar/FASTQS/UW_Trigg_190718_done/Sealice_F* .
	mv *.gz FASTQS/
	rm UW_Trigg_190718.tar.gz 


### copy data from Gannett to owl
- need to ask sam how to do this
- need to make new species directories for this data
	- C_rogercresseyi
	- S_salar
- made this [meta data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LM3-sf1IkK5jFR4Apc0gG73TEB9NOuxF9t9nWjffyu0/edit#gid=0) to add to the [Nightingales database google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XqIOPVHSBVGscnjzDSWUeRL7HUHXfaHxVzec-I-8Xk/edit#gid=0)

### run fastqc and trim
- prepared scripts (Salmon: /gscratch/srlab/strigg/jobs/20190719\_FASTQC\_ADPTRIM\_Ssalar.sh and lice: /gscratch/srlab/strigg/jobs/20190719\_FASTQC\_ADPTRIM\_Caligus.sh) to do this on Mox but didn't work because multiqc and cutadapt programs could not be found as I had them.
