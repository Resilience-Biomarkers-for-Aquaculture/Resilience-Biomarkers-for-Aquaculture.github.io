Fixed CO2 going to tank B1. I tried turning the outlet on and off on the apex power strip from my phone. This did nothing. I manually unplugged the solenoid and plugged it back in. I also disconnected the tubing and reconnected it to the venturi injector. After that, CO2 started bubbling again indicating a possible bubble was blocking the transfer of gas to the tank.
