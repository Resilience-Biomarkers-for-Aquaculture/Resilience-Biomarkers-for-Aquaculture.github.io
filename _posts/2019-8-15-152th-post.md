### Equipment brought to hatchery: 
- HgCl2 (stored in safety cabinet
- 100um silos (15 total)

### Equipment returned from hatchery:
- Sam's N2 dewers with samples
	- stored in lab here:
	 - [-80 inventory list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qsvz3QTURlPF_hX05BQxjom3484WuMfqQ1ILl9LEljU/edit#gid=2006985773)
	 - [slack post](https://geoduckffar.slack.com/archives/CB0E1FU3E/p1565926804036600)
- Mesh tubes for outplanting (56 total)

### Debrief with Sam:
- Extra spray bar plumbing under sink in dry lab
- repirometry: 
	- calibration to stickers, factory calibration is better than recalibrating. All read around 200umol/L at start of trial
	- ziploc baggie has all the vials
	- SDR plate needs to be secured to rotator for next trial (tape, etc.)

### FFAR Call 11-12:30:
- [Manuscript for broodstock reproductive development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YRoMQprj-cUQzBWzJ9lwSXrLbU3UYlutvDPb2QNlcMQ/edit)
- ![img](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1zoAZV0dojjpJB9mMgKetZmBJ6Y7oL0fx)
	- [histology data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ylVosCF3xVTM44xgBz8iFW01DKJdxG83DHr1mEXbFjc/edit#gid=0)
		- [histology pics](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1j_YA-PNsLHq2WzaS2LEssCwwL62yWpwc) 
	- hemolymph over time
		- brainstorm what we can do with this
			- tag-seq?
			- targeted proteomics
			- metabolomics
			- maternal RNA? Hollie's preliminary results showed an effect in maternal RNA (56%) 
			- review [Clare's paper, sperm WGBS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4060414/)
		- analyze preliminary WGBS data
	- for next meeting have:
		- Timeline for what needs to be done
		- results of histology
		- results of WGBS  
			- [alignments and coverage](https://shellytrigg.github.io/72th-post/) 
			- [methylkit DMRs](https://shellytrigg.github.io/79th-post/)
- [Manuscript for transgenerational plasticity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIho7R27-cXpDpuRKlQY_p-3Bi7-HlZMNQcTtH_bigI/edit)
	- add strip spawn protocol
	- add larval conical split out + survival info     
		
### Experimental set-up
- look at [Sam's paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6bQpwa27I2i8nHAQaHXkxZOaxAnKvF8Q68PGIi2o2U/edit) to determine timepoint for measuring acute stress

- played around with setup
- ![img](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XhIF9y5hFNXwli04Bv22dh9x5sEFWnIh)
- got a conical 2 going with variable low pH treatment and conical 3 going with ambient
