### Broodstock histology
Met with Kaitlyn in the am and came up with the following plan for scoring gonad histology:

1. Females: 
	- quantify follicle area
	- quantify egg area
	- calculate egg/follicle ratio
	- calculate follicle/tissue ratio
2. Males:
	- quantify acini/tissue ratio
	- quantify spermatagonia/spermatid ratio (dark purple to light purple)


### Comparing allc DMRs and 5x cov files

- [Steven's 5x cov files](https://osf.io/yem8n/):
	- still unsure about what happened in the strandedness code
	- include bases where MAPQ < 30
- [Allc files](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/metacarcinus/Pgenerosa/analyses/20190822/) generated by methylpy ([here](https://gannet.fish.washington.edu/metacarcinus/mox_jobs/20190822_DMRfindAllEPIsamples.sh)): 
	- filtered for bases with MAPQ >= 30 (--min-mapq 30 default)
- Methylkit processBismarkAln default includes a 'minqual' filter for MAPQ >= 20 
- Not sure if [DMG pipeline](https://github.com/lyijin/working_with_dna_meth) includes a MAPQ cutoff

**CONCLUSION:**  

- whatever files we use to validate our DMRs, DMLs, or DMGs, they must be filtered the same way.
	- Otherwise differences may not be apparent when all reads are included... 

Some lit on whether to use a MapQ score threshold or not:
