##My goals for today  
* work on Bismark alignment comparison  
	+ how does Bismark compare to Methylpy?  
		+ reference papers:  
		+ [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/shellytrigg/C_virginica/blob/master/MethylPy_comparison.ipynb)  
		+ install methylpy  
		+ try bowtie vs. minimap  
		+ make genomes  
	+ Insert size alignment setting  
		- in bowtie, this is the -I parameter  
			- default is 0; in methylpy it's 20.  
* Roberto's last day lunch @12:30
