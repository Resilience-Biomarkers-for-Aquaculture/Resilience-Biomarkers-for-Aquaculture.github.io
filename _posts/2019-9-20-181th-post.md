## Caligus call with Christian

- Christian talked about the backstory with the Sea lice that they are really susceptible to environmental change
	- salinity and temperature affect their life cycle
	- they are influenced by drugs
		- early stage lice have acquired resistance to the drug
		- late stage lice (sexually mature) are not resistant
	- is epigenetics the explanation to the resistance?
- Gustavo has found DNA methyltransferases and histone (N6) methyltransferases that show differential expression that correlates with
