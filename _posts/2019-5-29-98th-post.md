## March 17, 2019 strip spawned juveniles from ambient or varibable low pH exposed broodstock

- Installed new two-channel pump head and skinnier tubing (norprene 14) for feeding

- did algae counts on cellometer
	- inflow: 
		- Low pH header: 1.41 x 10^6 cells/mL
		- Ambient header: 1.24 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- outflow: 
		- H1T8: 1 x 10^5 cells/mL
		- Last H2 tray (empty): 8 x 10^4 cells/mL
		- rate = 10ml/3 sec. = 200mL/min. = 12L/hour = 288L/day
		- 1 x 10^5 cells/mL * 288,000mL = 2.8 x 10^10 cells/day
		- counting with the sedgewick slide I only got 5 x 10^3 cells/mL (~5 cells/square * 1000 mm^3 squares = 5000 cells/mL)
			- 1.44 * 10^9 cells/day
	**conclusions:** 
		- They are seeing 2,880 M cells /day counted by cellometer and 144 M cells/day counted by sedgewick
		-  They should be getting 22.4 M cells/day. 
		-  By cellometer, they are getting 2880M/22.4 ~128X more than needed and by sedgewick they are getting 144M/22.4M = ~6X more
		-  They are still getting more than needed, but are now getting less than before so it's likely better.
		
- shuffled trays around because cascading water system gives top trays more food

#### before shuffling
H2 stack (top tray is "Elev. Par. Hist. from T3 Elevated" but i had moved the label down to the second to bottom tray- where I was going to rotate that tray)

Animals seems to be doing well, but some are climbing up the walls of the tray (Brent suggested they're searching for better substrate). Hopefully they will stay happy enough. 

## Sam's experiment: March 1, 2019 ambient broodstock volitional spawn

- Ran water chemistry; [data here](https://github.com/shellytrigg/P_generosa/tree/master/Water_Chemistry/Data/Titrator/20190529)

- Checked animals and stack
	- Top tray in H1 stack (elevated treatment):

	- flow in the H1 stack is pretty minimal
