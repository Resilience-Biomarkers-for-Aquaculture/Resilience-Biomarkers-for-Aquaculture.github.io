## Geoduck Broodstock Experiment

- Set up continuous feeding system (Steven set this up)
	- filled silo with water
	- pump set at 100 which equals 5L/30 minutes. 
		- this can be adjusted by up/down arrows

- Set up first respirometry run with tanks 2 and 3:
	- first made rubbermade protective box for PreSens Oxy 10 but cutting out ports for probes and power cord to go through
	- set up tank 6 as the water bath with 3 brown flat racks upside down as a platform 
	- filled chambers with seawater from respective treatment tanks
		-Tank 2 (low pH):
		- control = no animal
		- chamber 1 geoduck biovolume + PVC = 170 ml
		- chamber 2 geoduck biovolume + PVC = 135 mL
		- chamber 3 geoduck biovolume + PVC = 160 mL

		-Tank3 (amb. pH):
		- control = no animal
		- chamber 1 geoduck biovolume + PVC = 150 mL
		- chamber 2 geoduck biovolume + PVC = 170 mL
		- chamber 3 geoduck biovolume + PVC = 130 mL
	
	- ran respirometry for 1 hr. 
		- In [Sam's trials](https://github.com/hputnam/Geoduck_Conditioning/tree/master/RAnalysis/Data/Oxy10_data/All_data_csv), O2 went from 
			- 225-198 umol/L = -27umol/L
			- 205-185 umol/L = -20umol/L
			- 239-226 umol/L = -13umol/L
			- 219-215 umol/L = 4umol/L * this must have been the control

		- O2 saturation at 9.8C based on waterontheweb.org calculator:
			- 100% = 11.34 mg/L
			- 50% = 5.67 mg/L = 5670 ug/L = 177 umol/L
			- 30% = 3.4 mg/L = 3400 ug/L =  106.25 umol/L
			- O2 = 32g/mol = 32ug/umol
		
		- animals in trial started around 230 umol/L = 7360 ug/L

		- [data here](https://github.com/shellytrigg/P_generosa/tree/master/Broodstock_Respirometry/data/20181203)
			- NOTE: tank 3 data got appended onto tank 2 data
				
		- computer crashed right at the end of tank 3 trial, but data was still collected and appended to tank 2 data
