title: Wed. Jan 23, 2019, Geoduck Broodstock Dissections
---

With Kaitlyn, Brent, and Sam at Point Whitney, we randomly selected 5 animals per tank from our low pH conditioning experiment started on November 12, 2018 for dissections. 

**Tank 1 (pH 6.8):**  
- 003
- 006
- 013
- 016
- 018

**Tank 2 (pH 6.8):**
- 023
- 028
- 034
- 037
- 040

**Tank 3 (pH ambient):**
- 1
- 4
- 5
- 13
- 17

**Tank 4 (pH ambient):**
- 041
- 044
- 045
- 050
- 052

From each animal, 
	1. Took hemolymph
	2. Tried gonad punch biopsy for sexing. This was challenging to punch the correct place and because the gonad is slippery and was hard to core. An otoscope or endoscope may be enough to go in through the pedal gap and see the gonad
	3. Shucked and took duplicate samples (one for N2 freezing and 1 for RNAshield) of ctenidia, siphon, and gonad. Took lateral gonad slices (about 2mm thick) and preserved in PAXgene tissue fix for histology. 
	4. Tried comparing crystaline styles, but saw no obvious difference
