## Abstract

Combining data from two compatible studies for meta-analysis, we ran
a series of exploratory DESeq2 runs, using variations of contrasts and sample sets. We found that differential expression of genes between pre-identified tolerant and sensitive samples was relatively independent of treatment (controls vs treated samples), indicating a possible innate DEG profile for tolerance.
