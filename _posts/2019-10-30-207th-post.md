### Methods:

- Methylpy DMRfind:
	1. root mean square test for each CpG within an individual to determine if mCG counts:CG counts is statistically different than what would be expected from "genetic origins of methylation variation" alone. If the CpG site is significant after FDR correction, it is considered a DMS (differentially methylated site)
	2. DMS are combined into blocks ("region") if they fall within a predefined window and have methylation changes in the same direction.
	3. Need to run group statistics
		- Examples of group statistics:
			- [clustering with BackSPIN](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5570439/)
			- [random effects model? "CpG cluster differential methylation was determined by pooling CpG level methylation differences using a random effects model"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821869/)

- Methylkit:
	1. calculateDiffMeth uses a logistic regression model to test if treatment has any effect on CpG (loci) methylation or region methylation. 
		- is log(πi/(1−πi))=β0+β1Treatmenti a “better” model than log(πi/(1−πi))=β0 ?
		- a q-value is calculated and a cutoff can be defined to select significant DMLs or DMRs 
			- this method is only capable of comparing two groups at a time. 

Reference: [methylkit documentation](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/methylKit/inst/doc/methylKit.html#36_finding_differentially_methylated_bases_or_regions), see section 3.6

- DMGs:
	1. bionmial glm comparison between methylated and non-methylated CpGs 
		- glm (methylated,non_methylated ~ pH * position, family = "binomial")
		- each treatment replicate is compared to a control replicate in a combinatorial fashion to assign equal weightage to each replicate

	2. Liew also does [glm on mean % methylation with gaussian method](https://github.com/lyijin/pdae_dna_meth/blob/master/diff_meth_genes/glm_showing_independence/glm.median_meths.py)
