title: Tues. Mar. 3, Point Whitney Silo Clean up
tags: Point Whitney Pt. Geoduck juvenile silo 
category: Geoduck response to low pH

## Notes from Feb. 14 spawn:
- 2M swimmers from 15M eggs (13% hatch rate) from Oct. 2019 harvested brood
- 1.5M swimmers from 4M eggs from tank 2 volitional spawn
- 0.5M swimmers from residual eggs from side experiment without KCl from Oct. 2019 harvested brood

## Update from Feb. 29 volitional spawn
- All 5 broodstock tanks (B1, B2, B4, B5, and B6) spawned
- 51.5M eggs from treatment tanks (B1 and B5)
	- reared in LRT
- 32.2M eggs from control tanks (B2 and B4)
	- reared in LRT 
- 14M eggs from B6
	- reared in conical
- In order to salvage as many eggs as possible, Matt and Josh siphoned everything up off the bottom of the totes, which transferred to the LRT. This included debris and dead stuff. Totes had been recently cleaned but flocked algae was present. They did not siphon off the bottom for B6 because they were less concerned about saving all of these.
- **Mar. 4 update:**
	- 5.1M dhinge from 32.2M eggs (15.8% hatch rate) from control group
	- 5.7M dhinge from 51M eggs (11.2% hatch rate) from treatment group
	- 4.5M dhinge from 14M eggs (32% hatch rate) from tank B6
	- Notes: brownish debris was present in the screens from the control and treatment groups, but not the tank B6, suggesting crap got transferred from initially siphoning the bottom of the tanks.
- **Mar. 5 update:**
	- counts down to 4M for treatment and control after dropping LRTs
		- Matt is concerned that because these are flat bottom tanks and he has to spray off the bottom to transfer them out of the tank that this might be harming the larvae. The LRTs are also a lot to maintain with regards to food (algae) and dropping. So Matt went ahead and transferred larvae to conicals. 

## Silo status
Took pictures of silos upon arrival:

The silo screens definitely seemed clogged as a few silos are nearly overflowing. This could be due to the flocked algae that went through the system on Saturday, Feb. 29. Again a few ports were not flowing.

- [images of juveniles with scale](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QDuQOvAAcKffxgvTg5hAjAkpFh90N2MF)

- measured shell length in imageJ and [shell length data is here](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/amb_v_varlowpH_juvis/analyses/20200303_ShellLength/20200303_ShellLength.xlsx)

**Need to run stats on survival and shell length**

- added silo animals to the heath stacks in the breeze way next to their siblings.
	- silos 3.1-3.5 added to heath stack labeled "ambient"
	- silos 3.8-3.12 added to heath stack labeled "elevated"
	- silos 3.7 and 2.7 with 1.5 yr old tagged juveniles were also added to "blue green" heath stack in breezeway. 

- silo juveniles will be used for respirometry demonstration on Mar. 5 at the Port Townsend Northwest Maritime Center for Salish Sea Expeditions training.

- Pooled silo juveniles with elevated parental history in bucket on top and ambient parental history in bucket on bottom:

- [Apex data](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/tree/master/Water_Chemistry/Data/Apex)
- poisoned samples to run Wed. Mar. 18 with Eileen  


## Brood setup
- pumps (circulation and venturi injector pumps) were switched off. Matt suggested Doug may have done that on Monday Mar. 2 when he was cleaning the tanks. 
- pH in B1 was at 7.8 as of Thur. Feb 27. I couldn't quickly figure out what the problem was, so postponed troubleshooting until Thur. Mar. 5.
