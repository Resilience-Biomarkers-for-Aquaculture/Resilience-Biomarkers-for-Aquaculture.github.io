title: Wed. Nov 14, 2018: Geoduck Broodstock Experiment
---

## FFAR meeting
- Can't untangle effects from high/low pH or static/fluctuating, so include additional fluctuating low pH treatment with new geoduck
	- Hollie has a code for this 

- Why is the oxygen low on Nov 10? What is the saturation of water at 9-10C and salinity @ 29 PSU ? 

- continuous feeding:
	- bringing peristatic pump 
	- there are also programmable pumps

## To-do on Friday Nov 16

1. water chemistry
	- discrete measurements
		- pH tris curve
	- titrator
		- pH cal
		- CRM
		- water samples

2. hemolymph samples from all animals
	- supplies needed:
		- liquid nitrogen carrier
		- at least 150 microfuge colored LABELLED tubes replace (need to order more)
		- needles
		- syringes
		- centrifuge (can we set the freezer to 4C and put it in there?)
		- styrofoam containers for carrying samples on ice to centrifuge (ice packs in freezer in garage) 
		- p1000 and tips for transferring lymph 

3. labels for animals (can do this while taking hemolymph)
	- maybe just mark with paint pen for now?

4. automate data download
	- enable remote access to router
	- test data download from dry lab building

5. calibrate temp probes

6.  Set up tanks 5 and 6 with gas
	- need to order 4 more pumps 
	- do we have probes for these?

7. Think about respirometry 
	- Presens is expensive, and preferred to stay in the dry lab
	- carting water (for containers and water bath) is lots of labor
	- need a solution

### Need to order: 
- 4 submersible pumps (Drs. Foster & Smith)
- 1.7 mL microfuge tubes 500ct Rainbow Pack (VWR cat no. 87003-296) $24.14  (https://us.vwr.com/store/product/4674613/vwr-microcentrifuge-tubes-polypropylene)
- calcium assay 96-well $215 (cayman chemical) https://www.caymanchem.com/product/701220
