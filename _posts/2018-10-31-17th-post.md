-Geoduck hemolymph extraction

-Met with Jose
	- he has experience with developing Vitellogenin ELISA assays in fish
	- Options:
		- ELISA: quantitative
		- Western Blot: not quantitative
		- qPCR: quantitative
		- Calcium assay; calcium correlated with vitellogenin (vitellogenin binds Ca2+)
		- assay for Upstream vitellogenesis inducer? (i.e. estradiol, although Brent says Geoducks likely don't have this)
	- To develop ELISA:
		- need 1) isolated vitellogenin and 2) antibody. Need isolated protein to generate standard curve and generate antibody
			- can isolate vitellogenin by:
				- fractionation? It's large
				- inducing expression
				- cloning and doing bacterial expression
			- can generate antibody by sending protein (or protein fragment) to commercial antibody lab (they inject rabbits)
	- To develop Western:
		- only need antibody
	- [Calcium assay](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/mak022?lang=en&region=US)

	- To develop qPCR:
		- need primers
		- need sequence
			- VTG superfamily domain?
				-BLASTX to get DNA sequence?
				-revtrans on serial cloer to get DNA sequence?
			- BLAST to Geoduck genome
				- build BLAST index out of Geoduck genome
				- align VTG superfamily domain to genome
				- align protein to genome
		- samples:
			- no template
			- non-DNase treated sample or gDNA prep?
			- RNApreps
				- hemocytes from different stages
					- immature
					- early
					- middle
					- late
					- post spawn
				- gonad tissue from different stages
					- immature
					- early
					- middle
					- late
					- post spawn
				- hepatopancreas
					- immature
					- early
					- middle
					- late
					- post spawn
