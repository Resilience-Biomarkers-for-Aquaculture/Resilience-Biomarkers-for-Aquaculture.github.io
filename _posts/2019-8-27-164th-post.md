### Equipment brought to Pt. Whitney

- 10x 10ft 3/4" PVC
- 5x 3/4" PVC ball valve (not threaded)
- 5x 3/4" PVC ball valve (threaded)
- 26x 7.4" x 13" x 10" 9QT plastic waste basket
- 25x 3/4" PVC 90 degree elbow
- 40x 3/4" PVC T
- screw tap
- PVC cement
- 150x [threaded adapters](https://www.usplastic.com/catalog/item.aspx?itemid=117424&catid=551)
- 25x [vinyl screw covers](https://www.widgetco.com/screw-thread-covers-protectors-8-1-2-white?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIn5XQ1oC25AIVRR6tBh3nTAuoEAQYASABEgLI4_D_BwE)

- Steven brought from Manchester
	- large manifold to test out
	- more silos (count up to 29x 100um)

### Experimental setup

- Hooked up manchester manifold to 1/2" tubing and pump (250gal/min) from LRT
	- not enough pressure to have each port flow evenly
	- tried capping off ports with vinyl screw covers, but still not even flow
	- got even flow with hatchery pump

	- ![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=10M0q3Q8nVp_rFAuee1icLGnMZ3fXPgC_)
		- pump is too much for water supply, it will burn through water
- Steven and I dry-fit two new manifolds, which are smaller:
- ![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dV18Sej7HPdIaePTjg5qyj7GGjMa4845)
	- 4x 26.5" PVC (3/4")
	- 4x 12.75" PVC (3/4")
	- 6x 7" PVC (3/4")
	- 2x 4.75" PVC (3/4")
	- 2x 6" PVC (3/4")
	- drilled three holes/middle bar and threaded with 1/4" NPT (1/2" OD) tap
	- covered each threaded adapter with teflon tape and screwed it in (tried to let water flow through first to flush out plastic shards, but not super effective)
	- added a small piece of pipe with a cap to close off one main port. 
	- attached a ball valve to other main port for tuning in-flow
	- hooked up 1/2" tubing and 250 gallon pump to manifold
		- water seems to be flowing evenly 
- added 12 silos to each tote by hanging 4 on one 44" x 1/2" PVC.
- put trash cans underneath each silo so their waste water doesn't touch.
- moved manila clam set up in 4 silos and spray bar to tote 4 with triploid brood

### Water chem

- decided on using totes as water headers after talking with Matt since they have the most reliable flow out of all the vessels in the rearing room. 
- cleaned probes in conicals (covered in biofilm)
- moved probes to different places between 4-6pm:
	- PH-T3 renamed to PH-B5 moved from amb LRT to tote 5 (amb)
	- PH-T2 renamed to PH-T5 and moved to low pH conical (Sam's exposure)
	- PH-T4 renamed to PH-T6 in amb pH conical (Sam's exposure)
	- PH-T5 renamed to PH-B3 in trash can in tote 3 with ambient silos
	- PH-T6 renamed to PH-B2 in trashcan in tote 2 with var. low pH silos
	- PH-T7 in H1T1 (not moved)
	- PH-B1 in tote 1 with var. low pH 
- Split CO2 gas with push-to-connect Y and red tubing from previous CO2 gas set up going into totes
- plugged in solenoid 1 with 2 extension cords going into outlet 8 in the power strip
- added circulated pump and pump with venturi injector into tote 1
- adjusted black knob on gas manifold to tune down amount of gas to make it less spikey. Previously in the LRT, the pH was really spikey because it didn't have a circulating pump for mixing and because the gas was turned on full force. [See this slack thread about it](https://geoduckffar.slack.com/archives/CB277GTCN/p1566609553004200)
- will run this treatment to monitor behavior before adding animals 

### Juveniles

- Checked on animals in upwelling heath stack
	- top 2 trays looked like they have some growth
	- T1 (amb):

	- bottom two trays have less growth but animals are crowding the back, where the in-flow is

- thought fouling might be from not having sand so I added ~100mL of large grain sand into each tray
- thought animals were crowding the back because not enough food, so increased algae by 3.75x 
	- turned on the second pumphead with 1/4" hosing and [L/S norprene 24](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/masterflex-l-s-norprene-food-tubing-a60-f-l-s-24-50-ft/0640224) (flows 3.75x more than the [L/S norprene 16 tube](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/masterflex-l-s-norprene-food-tubing-a60-f-l-s-16-50-ft/0640216) feeding each conical); pump still set at 160
	- shuffled trays
		- old order:

			1. T1
			2. T2
			3. T5
			4. T3
		- new order:
			1. T3
			2. T5
			3. T7
			4. T1

### Next steps
1. Check stability of treatment; adjust CO2 via black knob near output if too spicky
2. Hook up algae to totes (waiting until animals are transferred into silos before doing this to make sure they are getting enough food now)
3. Possibly move apex to tidy up probe wires if possible
4. Calibrate apex probes
5. Confirm var.low treatment conditions with discrete measurements
6. Drill outflow holes in silo bins so individual waste water doesn't spill over to neighbors
7. Combine trays from common parents, count and size (select) animals
8. determine number of animals to add/silo + sand
9. repair leaky manifold ports
10. clean up manifold valve plumbing with new parts
11. Fashion a cleaner draining system so totes don't just dump onto the floor but flow into the drain pipe
12. buy remaining supplies:
	- plumber's putty
	- teflon tape
	- cleaner fittings for valves on manifolds (temporarily used a couple crazy adapters Matt made)
	- Scissors (for dig and outplant)
	- ice packs (for dig and outplant)
	- tape measure (for dig and ouplant)
