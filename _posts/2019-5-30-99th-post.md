The West Coast Ocean Acidification Center held its biennial meeting at the Center for Urban Horticulture today. 

Here's the agenda: [Symposium 2019 Draft 4.docx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LP9OZu_WoS43EEcFvXWhL6oiF1PKRH7y)

Here's the abstracts: [WOAC 2019 abstracts.docx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1epUyPOlwH43BenUx4_mclRvE2bp8X-gu)

Here's the poster I presented after Paul's: [CrabMetab\_Poster\_Final.jpg](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DvaL5NIjdc0vQbs8G0BGLsb4aODS_0L1)

Here's the talk I presented: [WOAC2019\_STrigg\_metab.pptx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jkxy9Ak-hFnQwgGZTulo6uB9FYlf7_dU)

**Some interesting points were:**

[Simone Alin's](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Simone+Alin,+Ph.D.) work showing the 2015 blob year actually had "good" conditions while 2017 had "poor" conditions
	- this manuscript is in prep 

Micah Horwith's DNR work on oyster (gigas and oly) and clam (manila and geoduck) sea grass outplants showed varying results:
	- variation between sites, but overall consistent:
		- positive growth for oysters
		- no effect for geoduck
		- negative effect for manila clams
	-  perhaps due to clams burying while oysters stay on the surface?
	-  sea grass does not generate more CO2 at night because of biomass accumulation, fixation, and sluffing

[Julie Keister](http://faculty.washington.edu/jkeister/) and [Evelyn Lessard](https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/evelyn-lessard/) are finding different microbial community composition associated with different seasons, regions, and seawater chemistry from their cruise surveys (diatoms dominate, high in the spring, decline in the fall; dinoflag. high in the summer; noctiluca and ciliates in the spring and summer)
	- also check out [Vera Trainer's plankton studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568988319300356) about microbe toxicity/physiology changing with CO2 ([ORHAB](http://www.orhab.org/))
	
Check out:	

- [LiveOcean app](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/forecast_hypoxia.html) to see how winds, upwelling/downwelling, and fresh water input impact seawater current 

- [Nanoos climatology app](http://nvs.nanoos.org/Climatology) to see chlorophyll and when algae populations are more or less present

Nina Bednarsek's [paper on pteropod mortality and OA](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00486/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Marine_Science&id=401243)
	- she's also seeing dissolution of carapace in Dungeness crab megalopae by SEM (not published yet) 
	 - would be interesting to look at metabolomics data in light of this

**Thoughts from meeting**

- Everyone is very interested in community reponse in the field but not sure the best way to study it
	- eDNA stuff could be promising but still early on
	- how about [Simon's proposed method](https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/4/988) ([review here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6046294/)) on the water filter samples instead of eDNA?
	
- Everyone is also very interested in trans-generational effects and if adaptation seems possible
	- Laura mentioned [our lab's work](https://github.com/sr320/talk-mj-2019) on transgenerational effects on epigenetics
	- I mentioned [Kathleen O'Malley's papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kathleen_Omalley2) on dungeness crab genetic variation with regions
