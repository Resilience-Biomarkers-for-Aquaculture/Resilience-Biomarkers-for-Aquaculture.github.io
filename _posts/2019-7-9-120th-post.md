title: Tues. Jul. 9, 2019  Salmon RRBS + Zymo Pico Methyl prep 
---

## RRBS

- Followed digest and size selection plan exactly as outlined [here](https://shellywanamaker.github.io/110th-post/)
	- to get 1ug of DNA in 20uL for each sample, I followed [this doc containing the initial sample concentrations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuT3Fh3W1jRiirFufFn0I37vGuB-G8-lzGiYuEf3r_Q/edit#gid=1408449275) 
- DNA yield after digestion and size selection ranged from 20-110ng, which is on par with what I got in the [June 28 test run](https://shellywanamaker.github.io/110th-post/)
	- concentration and yields can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuT3Fh3W1jRiirFufFn0I37vGuB-G8-lzGiYuEf3r_Q/edit#gid=1408449275)
	- Digested size selceted samples (tubes labelled "sz gDNA 1-20") are stored in 209 -20C bottom drawer in box labeled "gDNA Salmon Skin sea lice infection (from Christian) S.Trigg"


## Zymo Pico Methyl kit prep

- picked up primers today from Biochem stores
- reconstituted in EB (Qiagen) @ 100uM
- added them to the [primer stocks inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tu1c9mzJFjL2vN5xwQctRLGQhLRNB0heha5ZQMrNsOA/edit?ts=5d24e439#gid=542518554)
- prepared 50uL of 10uM Index primer mixes following [Karolyn's instructions](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ZymoResearch_PicoMethylseq_IndexAlternatives.pdf):
	- 50uL Index Primer 10uM (section 5) = 
		- 5uL 100uM Ill\_TrSq\_P5\_Univ 
		- 5uL 100uM Ill\_TrSq\_P7\_# (where # = index 1-22)
		- 40uL EB
	- We now have Index Primer mixes 1-22 with #2,4,5,6,7,and 12 coming from the kit and all others coming from IDT/I made.

#### Plan for tomorrow

- Set up programs on PCR machine
- Aliquot out up to 50ng Salmon DNA ([see volumes here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuT3Fh3W1jRiirFufFn0I37vGuB-G8-lzGiYuEf3r_Q/edit#gid=1408449275))
- Aliquot out 50ng of sea lice DNA
- start library prep
