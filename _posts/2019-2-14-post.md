Geoduck genome

submitted 4 jobs to mox:
2 jobs to build genomes from v070-10K and v070-30K.
2 jobs to align RRBS data from 4 [juvenile geoduck samples 111,113,119, and 120](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/blob/master/Setup_Notes/Sample_List.csv). 

Once alignments are done, I'm going to see how they compare to [my previous alignments of this same data to the v070 genome with 300K contigs](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/BismarkAlignments/20181101/bismark_summary_report.html). 


Updating R to v 3.5.2:

manually installed binary packages (R-3.5.2.pkg, clang-6.0.0.pkg (dependency), and gfortran-6.1.pkg (dependency) from https://cran.r-project.org/

opened R stuido and followed instructions on this link:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13656699/update-r-using-rstudio

I manually copied all my packages from Library/Frameworks/R.Framework/Versions/R-3.4/Resources/library to Library/Frameworks/R.Framework/Versions/R-3.5/Resources/library

For updating packages, I added ask = FALSE to the update.packages command following this link:
