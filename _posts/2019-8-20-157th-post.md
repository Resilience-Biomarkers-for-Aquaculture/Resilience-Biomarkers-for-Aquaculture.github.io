### Equipment brought to Pt. Whitney
- 6x spray bars (48" x 1/2" PVC with threaded coupler on one end and cap on other)
- [100ft 1/2" tubing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D9CLGV3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- 8x [adjustable aquarium pumps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JPGID2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- 2x 22 piece plastic clamp set
- 4x [7.4" x 13" x 10" 9QT plastic waste basket](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rubbermaid-Spa-Works-9-Qt-Plastic-Waste-Basket-FG290200CLR/100546943)
- 24x [2.5 QT buckets](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-5-qt-All-Purpose-Mixing-Container-05M3HDX/204286575)

### Water chemistry
- got apex up and running in big LRT silos 
	- PH-T2 = var. low treatment
	- PH-T3 = ambient
	- didn't actually start the treatment until wed Aug 21
	
### Juveniles	
- changed H2 heath stack to upwell
	- moved all animals to 1mm mesh except the bottom two extra trays
	- flow now by pump (87 gal/hr), not gravity
	- Didn't add sand
	- rinsed animals before transfering them
		- sand was black in some areas
	- reordered trays 
		- Old order:

			1. T7
			2. T3
			3. T5
			4. T1
		- New order:

			1. T1
			2. T7
			3. T5
			4. T3   

- H1 stack: still fed by gravity

### Manila clam setters
- Brent added manila clams 
	- to some H1 trays
	- and to 4 silos on a hang bar + a 1/2" spray bar being fed by another ambient pump (87 gal/hr)

### Experimental Set-up progress
- Determined capped spray bars would end up with uneven flow with more flowing out of the holes closest to the in-flow
	- roughly eyeballed this with the 2.5qt buckets
- Came up with new set-up based on Mollie's set up at Taylor
	- 3/4" PVC looped manifold with [threaded adapters](https://www.usplastic.com/catalog/item.aspx?itemid=23769&catid=551) that flow water into silos 
	- manifold sits over silos suspended by PVC hang bars
	- manifold had a port for water to flow in through

### Chat with Sam about experimental setup (08/19/2019)
**Feeding:**

- Sam measured algae density for 2-3 tupperware tanks every week
	- took sample in 15 ml falcon tube and used cellometer
	- measured 50K cells/ml minimum 
- Sam used dosing pumps:
	- algae 400-500Kcells (1L/min)
	- calibrate 100mL: 
		- manual pump to fill line and purge b4 calib
		- press calib. use grad cylinder to fill 100mL
		- settings cycles/day: 24; set time and each hour
			- all 4 motors at a time may burn out motor so Sam staggered the dosing
			- 15 min for 2 L  
			- still need to set last channel for brief time, even when not using it

**water flow to mesh silos:**

- scenario 1: each conical goes to drippers by Ts and 1/4" tubing
	- dripper with orange lets out 6 Gal/hr 
	- pros:
		- even flow
		- flexibility 
- scenario 2: each conical goes to spary bar
	- cons:
		- uneven flow
			- shuffle silos?

**overall concerns:**

- variable low might differ between conicals
- dosing channel might break
- 2 replicates/ treatment cant really test the effect of conical
- flow rate may change/conical

### Next steps:
- monitor water chem in large silos and see if it's stable
- purchase supplies to build manifold (spray bars, containers, etc.)
	- 10x 10ft 3/4" PVC
	- 5x 3/4" PVC ball valve (not threaded)
	- 5x 3/4" PVC ball valve (threaded)
	- 26x 7.4" x 13" x 10" 9QT plastic waste basket
	- 25x 3/4" PVC 90 degree elbow
	- 40x 3/4" PVC T
	- screw tap
	- PVC cement
- build manifold and test it
	- here is a prettier picture of the design:

- Sequim bay dig (Aug. 29)
	- find new home for deplanted animals
- plan Sequim bay outplant (Aug. 30)
