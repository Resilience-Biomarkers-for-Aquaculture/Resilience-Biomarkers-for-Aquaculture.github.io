### Salmon sea lice project

- met with Steven and Christian today about directions for epigenetic exploration of salmon infected with sea lice
	- created [this doc to keep track of ideas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mD6ivb3xcfhvu_fF7dhYTLWytzXeYp8rheEvbTJKWnc/edit?usp=sharing)
	- also created [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1SuT3Fh3W1jRiirFufFn0I37vGuB-G8-lzGiYuEf3r_Q/edit?usp=sharing) to keep track of the ethanol-preserved Atlantic Salmon skin samples Christian brought.
- need to determine best method for epigenetic analysis for these samples (e.g. ATAC-seq, amplicon BS-seq, ChIP-seq, etc.)
	- it's hard to say how well the chromatin structure is maintained in ethanol fixed samples (see ATAC-seq references on [Epigenome methods slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mD6ivb3xcfhvu_fF7dhYTLWytzXeYp8rheEvbTJKWnc/edit?usp=sharing). This could contribute to variation between individuals.
	- From the references I found so far (see [Epigenome methods slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mD6ivb3xcfhvu_fF7dhYTLWytzXeYp8rheEvbTJKWnc/edit?usp=sharing)), it seems like RRBS or amplicon BS sequencing would be the better way to go.
