title: Fri. Jan 17, 2019,  Oyster Seed Proteomics to explain mortality
---

I took a quick look at Silo 2 vs Silo 3 proteomes because silo 2 had 2% survival where silo 3 had 10% survival.

graph is from [here](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/issues/338)


PCA of silo 2 and 3 technical replicates looked good so averaged the NSAF values.

Here's the heatmap of silo 2 vs silo 3.

Day 11 and 13 show stark differences in silo 2 compared to silo 3. The top cluster of proteins show very high expression and the bottom cluster show very low expression in silo 2 compared to silo 3. 

**Need to look into what these proteins are**
