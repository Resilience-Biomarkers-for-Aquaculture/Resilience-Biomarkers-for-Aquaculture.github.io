title: Mon. Jan 16, 2019  ASCA on average NSAF values of filtered proteins
---

This entry refers to [ASCA_avgNSAFvals_FilteredProteins.md](https://github.com/shellytrigg/OysterSeedProject/blob/master/analysis/ASCA/ASCA_filtered_proteins/ASCA_avgNSAFvals_FilteredProteins.md); R markdown file [here](https://github.com/shellytrigg/OysterSeedProject/blob/master/analysis/ASCA/ASCA_filtered_proteins/ASCA_avgNSAFvals_FilteredProteins.Rmd).

I redid ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) on average NSAF values of proteins that passed the filter for inconsistent detection in technical replicates ([see yesterday's post](https://github.com/shellytrigg/shellytrigg.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2019-1-15-33th-post.md)). 

The PCAs generated by the ASCA look a little different than last time when I had used the ADJNUMSPEC vals, included day 15, and day 0 for both temperatures.

I went ahead and did the analysis of proteins affected by temperature based on the PCA for temperature ('PC1 vs PC2 for factor-combination 2')(**a**), specifically looking at PC2 loadings values since this component shows the most separation between 23C and 29C. I made a heatmap plot (**d**) of proteins with PC2 loadings that fall within a cutoff I defined from loadings plots (**b,c**)

I added these methods and this figure into [our draft manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OusRSi9W5qLRcc3nuJm-kyQYrTQb7yPFiCBtqZIKNpQ/edit?ts=5c3f7cfc#).

It will be interesting to look deeper into what these proteins are that show higher abundance in 23C/ lower abundance in 29C; and vice-versa.
