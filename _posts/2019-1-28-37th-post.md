title: Mon. Jan 28, 2019, Geoduck Broodstock DNA extraction from Hemocytes 
---

Kaitlyn and I isolated DNA from four Jan. 4 hemocyte samples. Two samples were from Tank 2 (low pH) and two were from Tank 3 (ambient) treated animals. We used [the EZNA kit](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Omega_Mollusc-DNA-Kit-Combo-May-2013-D3373.pdf) and followed the manual with the following exceptions: 

 - We started on step 2 because we had cells not tissue, so no tissue homogenization was necessary
 -  Heat block in rm 213 was 59-65C instead of 60C because the digital setting was a few degrees off from the alcohol thermometer. 
 - In step 6, the volumes transferred were:
	 - 250uL for sample 16 
	 - 300uL for sample 15
	 - 350uL for sample 26
	 - 400uL for sample 25
- We eluted with 2 x 50uL elution buffer warmed to 70C. 


Then used 1 uL of each sample for Qubit BR. 
 
Standard 2 read 98 ng/uL and 102 ng/uL, so average is 100 ng/uL which is what it should be. 

**Here are the following qubit readings for the samples:**

| Animal ID | Tank | Treatment | Conc. (ng/ul)  | Total DNA (ng)  |
| ---- |:-----:| -----:|-----:|-----:|
| 15  | 3 | amb | 12.3 | 1230 |
| 16  | 3 | amb | 56 | 5600 |
| 025 | 2 | low (pH 6.8) | 8.3 | 830  |
| 026 | 2 | low (pH 6.8) | 7.4 | 740  |

We will send these for WGBS sequencing.
