##My goals for today  
1. Review geoduck literature and grant  
2. Continue brainstorming ideas for october experiment  
3. Complete Bismark analysis  
4. Update on protein stuff from Kaitlyn @kaitlynrm 
-Oyster proteomics: larvae in two different rearing temperatures  
	-experiment: 15 days of rearing; one group (silo 3) at 23C and one (silo 9) at 29C  
	-questions to address:  
		1. Does 23C proteome differ from 29C proteome over time?  
		2. Do the two 23C proteomes differ over time (silo 2 vs. silo 3)  
	-need to determine which proteins between the two groups are different (e.g. show different abundance trends over time)  
		-Try ACSA [Ref for ASCA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890747) ; [Ref for ASCA in metabolomics time series](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4559107/)  
		-Try Random Forest (can refer to its use in [MetaboAnalyst](http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/faces/home.xhtml); [MetaboAnalystR](https://github.com/xia-lab/MetaboAnalystR)) [Random Forest Methods in metabolomics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133491/)
