title: May 1, 2019  To Do
---

Projects:

# Salmon and sea lice
- inventory, order supplies, and plan DNA extractions

# Geoduck broodstock epigenomics
- post analysis
- check coverage

# Geoduck broodstock molecular study to complement histology and other data
- calculate respirometry stuff
- calculate water chem stuff
- review SamG.'s samples 
- consider hatchery samples

# Oyster Proteomics

write notes from meeting with Steven and meeting with grace


### Address what 'normal' development is:

- make GIF network or Shiny app
- networks need to be simpler (bubble plot)
- ** just total spectra under term vs considering number of proteins...am I already doing this?


Try changing heatmap
	- maybe include day 0 in the heatmap of selected proteins. Describe that day 0 was not included in stats to identify differences between temps because it was common. But it is included in the heatmap for a baseline proteome reference
	- order by days so temps are next to each other 

2. Compare data to development papers
	- Papers: 
	- Share with grace

3. Describe GO slims enriched relative to all the proteins in the genome 
	- get GO slims for uniprot mappings that have <= 10^-10 eval and see if GO slims of dev. proteomes are different

4. Network figures
	- post issue to decide if one is better than the other
	
# Pteropods pH x DO
- update water chem; calculate pCO2 and aragonite sat.
- plot discrete and logger data imposed
- update survival analysis with Paul's stat test8
