# Check on heath stack setup

- food still dicey, sometimes the food is unevenly distributed. 
	- ordered a new pump head today and they are sending some sample tubing to see if it will solve the problem (see below for more details). 
	- animals looked good but some algal floculation
		- counted about 5-7 animals in ~15 mL water/sand grab from second tray in heath stack ("extra" juveniles from variable low pH parents)
			- [Pics and footage of animals (variable low pH progeny)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IFSiXopwhTaoCxRvn49i3qF5vBfGpWRA)
		- need to clean mesh next week
		- need to shuffle trays around

			
# Algal counts
- Matt recommended setters should get a concentration of 100K/mL, but not more than that.

- Inflow algal counts direct from the feeding tube were:
	- H2 (ambient): 4.73 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- H1 (ambient/low pH): 	4.8 x 10^6 cells/mL
	- Flow rate of the feeding tube is 10mL/13 seconds = 0.77mL/second = 46.2 mL/minute = 66,528 mL / day = 35,260 M cells/day (66,528mL * 5.3 x 10^5 cells/mL)
		- 35,260M cells get into the header tank each day 

- Outflow algal counts were:
	- H2 (ambient): 5.3 x 10^5 cells/mL
	- H1 (ambient): 	3.8 x 10^5 cells/mL
	- Flow rate of the outflow is 10mL/3 seconds = 200mL mL/minute = 12,000 mL/hour = 288,000 mL/day
		- 288,000 mL * 5.3 x 10^5 cells/mL = 1.5264 x 10^11 cells/day

- [FAO manual](http://www.fao.org/3/y5720e/y5720e0b.htm#bm11.4.2) recommends 0.4mg dry algae per mg spat per week
 	-  	10^6 Iso cells = 0.02mg, so 20M cells/week or 2.857M cells/day
 	
 - Setter weight ~= 0.07mm^3 = 0.07mg? 
 	- H2 has ~ 52000 animals = 3.640 mg spat
 	- H1 ambient has ~ 60,000 animals = 4.2mg spat

**Conclusion**

- Ambient should be getting ~ 22.4M cells/day (2.857M cells/day * 7.84 mg total spat)
	- they are seeing 152,640 M cells/day
	- they are getting about ~6800X more than they need (152,640 M / 22.4 M) 


**Solutions**

- will try reducing the diameter of the masterflex tubing
	- Cole-Palmer sending a free 1-ft. sample of [skinnier masterflex tubing](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/masterflex-l-s-norprene-food-tubing-a60-f-l-s-15-50-ft/0640215). It's about half the diameter of the one currently being used and flows at 1/2 the speed.

- ordered [another pump head from Cole-Palmer](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/masterflex-l-s-easy-load-ii-head-for-high-performance-tubing-pps-ss/7720062?pubid=EW) to eliminate the inconsistent feeding from the "T" splitter that's currently being used to split the rations between headers

- [ordered more 1/4" clear tubing from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D9D35T6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to run from the algae header to our headers 


			
# Water chem
Kaitlyn and Eileen ran TA on H1 water samples. [TA data here](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/tree/master/Water_Chemistry/Data/Titrator) and [discrete chem data here](https://github.com/shellywanamaker/P_generosa/blob/master/Water_Chemistry/data/Titrator/Daily_Temp_pH_Sal.csv)

- Still need to run poisoned samples from H1T5-T8 from 4/19 and from 5/2. We can do this next week.
