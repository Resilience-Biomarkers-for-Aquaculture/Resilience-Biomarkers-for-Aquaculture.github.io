title: Mon. Aug. 5, 2019 Geoduck genome and juv exp plans
---

## Geoduck genome paper	
Met with Steven and Sam today to recap our status

**TO DO:**

- Start alignment for certain samples
	- maybe base this off samples that had the best coverage of v070 from [this analysis](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/MethylKit_JuviPgenr_diffpH/GeoduckSubsetAlignmentTest.md) or  plot Steven's data like [here](https://github.com/shellytrigg/Shelly_Pgenerosa/blob/master/analyses/MethylKit_JuviPgenr_diffpH/GeoduckSubsetAlignmentTest.md) for coverage assessment of samples
	- OR just pick the same samples I already started analyzing on Emu and align them against v74 (day 145 amb-low and super.low-low samples: 205,206,214,215,220,221,226,and 227).
	- align to Steven's v074 Bismark genome  

## Geoduck experiment planning
Met with Steven and Brent about experimental plans for Geoduck juveniles:

**_2019 Juveniles from conditioned brood_**

- set up long term (2 months) pH exposure in totes
	- 2 x replicate totes for ambient
	- 2 x replicate totes for var low pH (same program as brood)
- perform acute exposure to:
	- pH
	- temperature
	- salinity
	- lagoon water?
- accute measurements:
	- measure respirometry directly in altered H2O?
 

**_Collecting remaining Sequim 2018 juveniles_**

- When: possibly aug 28-30 
	- Tides: Wed Aug 28 8:42am -1.58, Thu Aug 29 9:31am -1.74, Fri. Aug 30 10:17am -1.57
- Who:	
	- Need someone with stinger and pump to help retrieve animals (Brent will contact Jamestown about this)
- Exp. plans: 
	- possibly add these animals along side 2019 juveniles from conditioned broodstock in exposure experiments  
- **NEED:** 
	- inventory of animals in the lab and in the field to see if we have enough from each treatment group
	- for dig up day: labeled containers to keep treatment groups separate and cooler to transport all back to pt. whitney
	- heath trays set up at Pt. Whitney to hold animals after transported back
- [Sam's map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O-PeLSdufEsZLG8eBS8WVL2lQ8wPLA5_aTtZ924AehY/edit) and [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJ8eqI2lJ3yVV54dZJiSObXe1KdvfZINxBHSGbksPIk/edit#gid=0) for outplanted animals

**_Outplanting 2019 juveniles_**

- When: day after retrieving 2018 juveniles
	- Can reuse tubes
- Need labeling system and map
