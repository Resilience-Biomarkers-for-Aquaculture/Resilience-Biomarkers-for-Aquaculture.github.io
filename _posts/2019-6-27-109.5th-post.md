### Checking on juveniles

Check out Jamestown's juveniles!:

Sam and I rinsed all screens in heath stack 2 and 1. We did this by filling a tote lid with clean sea water and one person seived with the screen sort of submerged while the other person sprayed with the special nozzle.

H2_T2 before cleaning (48 days since May 9 cleaning):

I shuffled the heath stack 2 trays around because again there was a difference in the amount of feed.

- original order (from May 29):
	1. H2_T2 (low density)
	2. H2_T6 (extras)
	3. H2_T1
	4. H2_T7
	5. H2_T5
	6. H2_T3

- shuffled order:
	1. H2_T3
	2. H2_T5
	3. H2_T7
	4. H2_T1
	5. H2_T6 (extras)
	6. H2_T2 (low density)

#### counting juveniles
Sam and I attempted to count the juveniles from H2_T2 (low density) by following [the method Matt previously showed me] (https://shellytrigg.github.io/106th-post/). They filled up about 20mL in the graduated cylinder. After counting > 300 and only being ~1/4 the way around the circle, maybe even less, we determined the we should wait until the animals are bigger to do counts. 
	
#### sizing juveniles
Sam and I took pictures to get sizes on juveniles from H2\_T2 and H2\_T6. They are around 2-4mm.

### Waterchem Status 
One Apex is down and may need servicing 

Working Apex currently has:

- 3 probe sets (pH, temp) for maintaining heath stack 1
- 3 probe sets for new experiment with animals from heath stack 1

### Ideas for pH x temp experiment

#### set-up:
- 2 low pH probe for low pH conicals (high and low temp)
- Heaters plugged into apex temp probes 
- use heath tray as alternating water source and animals (12 trays total: 4 header trays and 8 rearing trays)
- cascade set up with screens 
- do discrete measuremnets on all trays

### Measurements:
- for protein assay, Sam's idea for sampling animals: 
	- use whole animal and pool animals from same treatment, split homogenate across multiple assays
- for respirometry: 
	- Sam normalizes by average shell length
		- does this correlate with respiration rate?  
		- could do total shell length? maybe that's essentially the same?
		- 5 animals = enough to elicit signal

### Sam's plans:
- Outplanting heath stack 1 juveniles in early August
