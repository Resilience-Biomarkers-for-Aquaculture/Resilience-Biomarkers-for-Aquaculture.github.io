category: Geoduck response to low pH

## Respirometry 
- Ran 1 respirometry trial with 1 animal/vial; each animal from different silo
- filling vials (tried something different):
	- filled 2.5qt HD buckets halfway with 20um filtered treatment water (this would probably be better with a vaccuum filtration unit, syringe filtering is pretty terrible)
	- placed 12 vials in 24-well plate (as holder to maintain silo ID) and submmerged in treatment water
- added 1 animal to each vial
- brought back to lab by carrying buckets in light protected box
- @4pm capped vials submerged with corresponding numbered caps 
- checked for bubbles
		- dried with microfiber towel the kim wipe
		- placed randomly in 24 well reading plate
- started trial @ 4:08pm and stopped @ 5:12pm

- got total animal wet weight

- got shell length

## Final check and clean up
- calibrated all 4 probes
	- probe calibration looked good for totes 2 and 3
	- recalibrated tote 1 and tote 5 probes 
- checked on flow
	- flow looked good 
- removed macomas and total animals/silo

## Water chem:
#### Discrete measurements:
- calibrate pH probe
	- used new Mettler Toledo probe for Orion; throwing out old one and ordering a new backup one
- do tris curve
	- tris curve looked good
- took discrete measurments
	- looked normal at first glance 
- ran TA 
**I need to resolve discrepencies in my local water_chemistry directory with my online GitHub repo**
