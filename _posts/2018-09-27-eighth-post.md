## My goals for today  
* FISH 546 9-10
* Epigenetics reading group @ NOAA NWFSC 12:30-1:30
	+ [transgenerational of envronmental info](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6335/320)
	+ thoughts: stress opens heterochromatin => transposon/pseudo gene?/protogene? expression; does the cell just go crazy under stress and hope something works? Or is there a non-random mechanism that selects for advantageous changes?
	+ siRNAs silence TEs: [piRNAs specificly target transposons and this is heritable](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5554785/#abs0010title)
	+ should we be doing ChIPseq of H3K9me (heterochromatin mark) to complement methylation data if H3K9me marks change under stress like they do in the paper?
* TGIT 4-6
