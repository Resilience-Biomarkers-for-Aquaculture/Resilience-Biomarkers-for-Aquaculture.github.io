After 90 min. dye front ~3/4 to the bottom of the gel. Kind of hard to tell, but you can see faint purple right above the red plastic towards the bottom.

Because I ran a 0.8% the separation of high molec. weight wasn't really great, but it was enough to see that most of the DNA is above the 4th ladder band (15KB) which is great!

There is definitely some degradation () but it's not too bad.

It's probably possible to remove small molec. weight DNA with beads, but not sure if it's worth trying to clean these samples up and how these small fragments might affect the data.
