## juveniles from last year
Grace and Kaitlyn worked on this:
	- counted, measured, and took pics of them
	- moved them into clean trays, and removed sand

## Optimizing the heath stack set-up

Steven and I worked on this:
- Upon arrival:
	-  H2T2 ('amb par hist. from T2') had no water
	
- We simplified the plumbing to have one water source into the heath stack, each tray flows down to the next, and out the bottom tray.
