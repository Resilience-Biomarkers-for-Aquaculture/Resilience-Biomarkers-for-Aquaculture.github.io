### Summary of RRBS in the lit:

- [Robinson et al 2019, Atl. salmon fry](https://www.g3journal.org/content/9/5/1597#sec-1)
- [Moghadam et al 2017, Atl. salmon fry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05222-2)
- [Mac's paper, WA steelhead](https://www.g3journal.org/content/8/11/3723)
- [Webster et al 2018, Atl. salmon fry](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2018.1554520)
- [Lee et al 2014, human](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3895702/): double digest with Taq-a1 and MspI shows 7.4% gain in CpGs in CGI regions, 41.8% gain in CpGs in non-CGI regions, 6.3% gain in CGIs and 12.7% gain in promoters

### Next steps
1. Digest 2ug DNA
	- doing 2ug because I don't know what the yield is going to be like after gel size-selcetion
	- [get 2ug DNA in 35uL H2O](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SuT3Fh3W1jRiirFufFn0I37vGuB-G8-lzGiYuEf3r_Q/edit#gid=1408449275) 
	- **MSPI digest reaction mix**:
		- 31.5uL MSPI (21 * 1.5uL MSP1/sample)
		- 105uL Buffer (21 * 5uL cutsmart/sample)
		- 178.5uL Water (21 * 8.5uL H2O/sample)
		- 315 = final vol.
		- **add** 15uL master mix/sample
	- incubate @ 37C 12 hrs
	- heat inactivate @ 80C 20 min
	- hold @ 4C	
	- **Taq-aI digest reaction mix**:
		- 63 uL Taq-a1 (21 * 3uL Taq-a1/sample)
		- 21 uL Buffer (21*1uL cutsmart/sample)
		- 126 uL Water (21 * 6uL H2O/sample)
		- 210 = final vol.
	- **add** 10uL master mix/sample
	- incubate @ 65C 2 hrs
	- heat inactivate @ 80C 20 min
	- hold @ 4C

2. Gel purify
	- excise fragments between 80-280bp (seems like 100-300bp would be fine)
		- there may be a small size range that we want to exclude, but it's not clear what range and if its even possible. *see frag. size range info below   	
	- use Millipore columns
	- measure concentration with Qubit HS

3. Begin zymo pico methyl kit 

 
### Notes on fragment size selection after Taq-aI/MspI digest
 
- Lee paper selected 150-197bp and 207-230bp (and excluded 198-206bp) after adapter ligation
	- paper clarifies this range corresponds to 80bp-160bp fragments (before adapter ligation); suggesting adapters add 70 bp to the fragments.
	- the reason for the small size exclusion is because in silico analysis showed fragments within this size contained repetitive sequences that won't map.

- Mog. paper selected 150-250bp and 250-350bp after adapter ligation
	- I emailed Mog. to ask why two seperate ranges when they seem overlapping and confirm whether or not there was a fragment size exclusion
	- if the adapters used were the same length as in Lee et al, Mog. fragments pre-adapter ligation would be 80-280bp. This is pretty close to what Mac size-selected (100-300bp).
