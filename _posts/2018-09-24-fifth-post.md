## My goals for today  
1. Lab meeting @ 10  
2. Meet with Steven to decide projects to focus on  
2. SAFS kickoff @ 2-5  
	
### Notes from lab meeting  
* Sam's working on oyster transcriptome and genome assembly    
* Kaitlyn's working on oyster proteomics temperature x time series analysis  
	+ pharmacokinetics toolkit applicable? (Brent asked)  
	+ RNA-seq time series analysis tool applicable?  
* Yaamini's working on reviewer comments for JSR submission on oyster broodstock DMR comparison under OA conditions   
	+ what is the best way to vaildate methylation levels?  
		+ MSP vs. MBD or both? Need data relevant to physiology    
* Brent's working on lots of grants and coordinating Pt. Whitney setup  
	+ Pt. Whitney: need to set a date, set up CO2 tanks  
		+ monitoring Geoduck over time by  
			+ measuring respiration weekly  
			+ hemolymph sampling (how contaminated with sea water will this be?)  
				+ where's the best place to poke?  
					+ heart (Brent tried, not best survival rate)  
					+ aductor muscle (maybe too small, size of an eraser)  
					+ siphon  
				+ ELISA for vitellogenin to tell dev. stage  
					+ can we order an commercial ELISA kit to test on Geoduck?   
					+ can we test kit with old hemolymph sample where vitellogenin was expressed?  
				+ [SRM]https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/pr400444m)  
			+ non-lethal gonad biopsy ([Emma's paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00288))  
			+ histology? at least on some for validation of dev. stage  
* Laura's working on summer histology analysis on OWL (protocol on Git). Austrailia work was temp. association with spawning and using histology to quantify eggs to tell stage:  brooder vs. non-brooder. Also doing OA Oly. RNAseq data analysis pipeline  
* Emma's working on hatchery microbiome with OA conditioned Geoduck. Comparing traditional assembly to MOCAT to 6-Gill and digging into unaligned reads. Larvae at pH 8.2 had ciliates in seawater, ciliates didn't grow at lower pH treatments.  

### Notes from meeting with Steven  
* Geoduck project options:  
	+ OA methylation data analysis  
		+ Have RRBS data from many different days.  
			+ figure out comparisons to do  
			+ what data is good (i.e. minimum # of loci/sample)  
			+ samlpe descriptions in Ronnit's notebook  
	+ Geoduck transcriptome analysis for evolutionary comparison or alt. splicing comparison  
		+ Lots of illumina data from many tissue samples from the same individual  
			+ one tissue is the crystalline style (precursor of the thyroid)  
			+ Analysis = running trinity and BLAST  
				+ Check Steven's lab notebook entry on this  

### my thoughts on metrics for monitoring OA effects  
* defining what's normal (i.e. a process that shows fitness)  
	+ [high PUFAs = healthy?](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2013/284329/)  
	+ ATP levels?  
	+ TCA activity?  
	+ Protein degradation activity? ([Christina Frieder papers](http://www.christinafrieder.com/publications.html))  
	+ Activity of TEs/TE machinery abundance?
