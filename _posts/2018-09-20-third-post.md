## Met Steven and Katherine at Pt. Whitney  

Toured facility and got pictures of OA experimental setup   
Brainstormed some ideas for potential Geoduck broodstock experiments to start next month:  
-seawater flowthough system needs to be set up  
	-have 6 boxes: 2 pH conditions x 3 replicates; 3 pH conditions x 2 replicates  
-Things to think about:  
	-Ecological vs. aquacultural implications: Geoduck normally live in sand, boxes won't have sand.  
-Biology to explore:  
	1. Gonad development  
	2. Gametogenesis  
	3. Respirometry  
	4. lethal subsampling vs. hemolymph sampling (see Emma's paper)  
	5. Metabolomics  
		-West Coast Metabolomics Core?  
		-UW mass spec core?  
	6. Epigenetics
