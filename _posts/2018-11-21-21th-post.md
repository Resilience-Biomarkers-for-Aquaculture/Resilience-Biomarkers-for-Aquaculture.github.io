## Geoduck broodstock experiment 
- ordered pH and temp probes for Apex
- checked temperature probe after DI water spilled on it
	- its working fine

### Respirometry
	- couldn't find software or hardware to run on my computer here
	- downloaded Oxy-10 mini software on my windows 7 VW
		- won't run without machine plugged in
	- will try to run on Wednesday at hatchery
	- On Slack, Sam said the software is on the Putnam lab laptop

### Hemolymph Sampling
- washed all syringes used during sampling (1:10 bleach bath, DI water bath, 70% EtOH bath, dry over weekend)
- checked SAFS geoducks at 1:15, fed 5mL in ~5L 
	- they looked pretty health today
	- sampled around 4:30 with no problems, got blood right away. Still made the wrinkling siphon 
	- kept samples on ice until centrifuging at 4C for 10 min at 1000 RCF, stored in box in -80 C

### Water Chemistry and programming variable pH
- calculating daily variability
	- used data from october to nov 12 because the data I downloaded Nov 12-16 was data for the other Apex.  When Kaitlyn and I reset the router, maybe it reassigned the IP address?

	- for variable pH programs I made a table of hourly mean pH values from all the days of data. The SD is 0.5 which is large for pH. I'm not sure whether to use that data or whether to try to figure something else out (see below).

	- we don't know which outlets the solenoids for tanks 5 and 6 are in so we'll have to set this up next week

**potential Apex code if two equation variables are possible**

```
Real Outlets:

{tank5 outlet}
Set OFF
If Output Var_pH_1 = ON Then ON

{tank 6 outlet}
Set OFF
If Output Var_pH_2 = ON Then ON

Virtual Outlets:

pHVarLow_1
Set OFF
If pH_5 +1 < pH_3 Then OFF
If pH_5 +1 > pH_3 Then ON

Var_pH_2
Set OFF
If pH_6 +1 < pH_4 Then OFF
If pH_6 +1 > pH_4 Then ON

Low variable pH

Plug_3:
Set OFF
If Output Time1-PHX7 = ON Then ON

If Output Time3-PHX7 = ON Then ON

Virtual Outlets:

Time1-PHX7
Set OFF
If PHX7 < 6.80 Then OFF
If PHX7 > 6.80 Then ON

If Time 14:00 to 20:00 Then OFF

Time 2-PHX7
Set OFF
If pH_x < 6.9 Then OFF
If pH_x > 6.9 Then ON

If Time 12:00 to 14:00 Then OFF
If Time 16:00 to 18:00 Then OFF
If Time 20:00 to 23:59 Then OFF

Time 3-PHX7
