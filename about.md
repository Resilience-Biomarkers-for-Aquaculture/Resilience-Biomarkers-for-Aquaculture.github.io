### Project Summary

Economic challenges imposed by climate change and disease on the aquaculture industry
necessitate advances for improved animal welfare and resiliency. Biomarkers associated with
environmental and disease resilience traits can be leveraged in breeding and management
strategies. However, their discovery has been limited in part by the complexity of molecular
systems and the cost of genomics tools used to understand them. Advances in computational
approaches including machine learning algorithms, together with the wealth of genomic data that
has amassed, enable powerful meta-analyses for improved biomarker discovery in aquaculture
species.

This project aims to advance the discovery and characterization of biomarkers
through mining publicly available shellfish genomic datasets from resilient populations.

**The objectives are to:**

1) Develop standardized open-access, user-friendly, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for resilience biomarker discovery through systematic reanalysis, data integration and meta-analysis  

2) Build a user-friendly open-access comprehensive database of candidate resilience biomarkers that is widely available for use by the aquaculture community.

The resulting database will enable improved molecular tool development for more efficient
phenotype selection and health monitoring, implementation of selection methods that use a systems biology approach for simultaneous
improvement of multiple traits, and ultimately increased animal fitness and improved animal welfare.
