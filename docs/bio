I am a West Coast transplant, originally from Boston, MA. In Boston, I earned a B.S. in Biochemistry from Simmons College (now University), and continued on as a research technician at the Center for Cancer Systems Biology (CCSB) at Dana Farber Cancer Institute. In doing high throughput protein interaction screening, I became fascinated with interactomes (large protein interaction maps), big data, and how network biology brings resolution to genotype-to-phenotype relationships. Craving a deeper understanding and a break from Boston winters, I joined the Joe Ecker's Genomic Analysis Lab at the Salk Institute in San Diego as a research assistant to work on developing a new assay for mapping protein interactions that could eventually be applied to  non-model organisms for understanding how cellular networks vary across cell types and give rise to a particular phenotype. I was inspired to pursue graduate studies across the road at UC San Diego, and began a Ph.D. program in Biological Sciences in 2013. Part of the cell, molecular, and genetics biology track, I continued my research in Joe Ecker's lab now focused on understanding protein interactions that directly contribute to gene regulation in arabidopsis. In the summer of 2018 I completed my dissertation "High resolution molecular networks from novel 'omics' approaches elucidate survival strategies in organisms from land to sea" and received my Ph.D. in Biology. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Roberts lab, interested in the molecular effects from ocean acidification in fish stocks, and how this information could inform fisheries management.
