### NOAA and National Marine Sanctuaries

- **Video short (2019):**  [Dungeness crabs in changing waters](https://videos.fisheries.noaa.gov/detail/videos/west-coast-region/video/6029222940001/dungeness-crabs-in-changing-waters:-research-on-ocean-acidification?autoStart=true) 
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellytrigg/shellytrigg.github.io/img/dCrab_Fullvid.jpg)](https://videos.fisheries.noaa.gov/detail/videos/west-coast-region/video/6029222940001/dungeness-crabs-in-changing-waters:-research-on-ocean-acidification?autoStart=true)
Research suggests that Dungeness crabs are sensitive to the increasing acidity of our oceans. This research will help answer the question of how ocean acidification affects Dungeness crab and will inform strategies to sustain this robust fishery. I helped curate and advise the production of this video. 

- **Educational Toolkit (2018):**  [Ocean Acidification Communication Toolkit: Dungeness Crab Case Study](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/education/crab-toolkit.html)
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellytrigg/shellytrigg.github.io/img/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-12%20at%203.23.04%20PM.png)](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/education/crab-toolkit.html)
This communication toolkit is designed for educators and communicators to use to teach others about the impact of ocean acidification on Dungeness crab. The toolkit includes fact sheet, infographic, PowerPoint slideshow with script, reference list, resource list, public domain video B-roll, and public domain images. I developed this toolkit in collaboration with the NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center, West Coast National Marine Sanctuaries outreach team, and Freelance Photographer (and my husband) [Austin Trigg](https://austintrigg.com/noaa-washington-fish-and-wildlife).

- **Webinar (2018):**  [Be a Claw Abiding Citizen: Learn how Ocean Acidification could Affect Dungeness Crab](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/education/teachers/be-a-claw-abiding-citizen.html) 
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellytrigg/shellytrigg.github.io/img/NMS_Webinar20181017.jpg)](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/education/teachers/be-a-claw-abiding-citizen.html)
What is ocean acidification? And how could it affect the future of Dungeness crab, one of our favorite seafoods? Join us as we walk through a new national marine sanctuaries educational toolkit to equip you for teaching others about what ocean acidification could mean for the Dungeness crab, how this is currently being investigated, and resources to get more involved. This is a webinar I presented describing the contents of the toolkit and how they can be used. 


### Salk Institute for Biological Studies
- **Video lab tour (2016):**  [Meet Salk Plant Biology 2016](https://youtu.be/9HdoPcgRO4w)  
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellytrigg/shellytrigg.github.io/img/Sequence%202%20cover%201.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9HdoPcgRO4w)
This is an introduction to and virtual tour of the Plant Biology research happening at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, CA given by PhD student Shelly Trigg (Ecker Lab). It was produced by Aaron Howard (Video Communications) with help from Dona Mapston (Education Outreach Director) at the Salk Institute. It was shown to visiting community college students in conjunction with a plant biology seminar given by Dr. Carl Procko (Chory Lab) in Fall 2016.

- **Video curriculum (2016):**  [New Frontiers in Science Education Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb6xvHVhpwQ&feature=youtu.be) 
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shellytrigg/shellytrigg.github.io/img/AAAS_newFrontiers.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb6xvHVhpwQ&feature=youtu.be)
This video was developed by the Salk Education Outreach team as part of the New Frontiers in Science Education project funded by AAAS. It features Dr. Amy Rommel on her brain cancer research journey at the Salk Institute assisted by two high school students. Because this style of video is meant to provide exposure to real present-day research while building critical thinking skills, there are pausing points throughout the video to discuss topics in a classroom setting. I was on the advisory committee for this video alongside the Salk Education Outreach directors, Salk research scientists, and regional high school teachers. 

## Events

### 2019 SAFS Open House

	This is an annual 1-day conference designed to inspire young girls with STEM. I have led multiple workshops over the years and even designed my own in 2014 (["Excuse me, your DNA is showing"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B48Fm4_B1Qqpdnd2QnFuR2hSSUxScGhORU11UDJvSWM5ZFVJ)).

Other workshops I've led include ["What's in your water?"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ycwl5tH3hf338On0qThPj11aLjJQONFd) (more info in [my article](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ygPwp-8fmnoukOqH1v99YcyV2hkjDkfj) published [here](https://www.awissd.org/images/newsletter/May_June_2013.pdf) and ["Crime scene sleuths"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o5wE30YRXAdQI9ModbsvMrF7kWBO7v0k) (more info in [my article](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B48Fm4_B1QqpanZUMkNTbDdCSE1qS2Q0bHptXzNGVkxYYUU4) published [here](https://www.awissd.org/images/newsletter/May_June_2015.pdf).

## SciArt

These graphics were created in collaboration with [Austin Trigg](https://austintrigg.com/), Lisa Servilio and Jamie Simon (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies). They eventually made it on the cover of Nature Methods for the August 2017 issue!
