# Resilience Biomarkers Field Guide

Welcome to the Resilience Biomarkers Field Guide for aquaculture omics data analysis!

## Overview

This field guide provides practical guidance for discovering and applying resilience biomarkers from multi-omics data in aquaculture research. The guide synthesizes meta-analysis approaches and best practices for identifying molecular signatures that predict organism resilience under various stress conditions.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this field guide are to:

- **Provide practical workflows** for analyzing omics data to identify resilience biomarkers
- **Share best practices** for integrating multi-omics datasets
- **Document methods** for meta-analysis of publicly available aquaculture omics data
- **Support reproducible research** with clear methodological guidance

## Target Audience

This guide is designed for:

- Aquaculture researchers working with omics data
- Bioinformaticians analyzing stress response and resilience
- Graduate students learning multi-omics integration approaches
- Industry professionals seeking to apply biomarker-based selection strategies
